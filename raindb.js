Drag & drop the files 'consoleLog.txt', '/BepInEx/LogOutput.log' and 'exceptionLog.txt' (if it exists) from the folder '/Steam/SteamApps/common/Rain World/'. These logs get deleted or cleared when you launch the game. Send them after you encounter the issue.<br><br>[h1]FAQ[/h1]<br>[h3]Q1: The mod doesn't work. I can't open the mod's option menu. How to fix this?[/h3]<br>A1: Sometimes the mod is not initialized or applied correctly. You can re-apply it in the REMIX menu. Disable and enable the mod, and then press 'APPLY MODS'.<br>A2: One thing that helped multiple people is to delete the 'Rain World/BepInEx' folder and then verifying the integrity of the game files in Steam.<br>A3: Maybe this more extensive strategy works for you:<br>- Delete RW completely.<br>- Then deactivate downpour on steam client so it won't download.<br>- Install RW again.<br>- Apply all mods that you want in remix and test them<br>- Continue if they work now<br>- Activate downpour on steam so it would download<br>- Activate downpour mods in remix<br>- Reboot the game<br><br>[h3]Q2: The mod doesn't seem to work on Linux / SteamDeck. What can I do?[/h3]<br>A: You can try to add [b]WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winhttp=n,b' %command%[/b] to the launch options (in Steam: right click >> Properties >> General). After that, disable all mods, restart and then enable them again.<br>If that doesn't work there are other threads about Linux and SteamDeck on the [url=https://discord.gg/rainworld]Rain World Discord[/url] server.<br><br>[h3]Q3: The game freezes when entering a region. How to fix this?[/h3]<br>A: The game might actually not be frozen. The mod needs to generate files for each region. This can take time (>1 minute). Wait a bit. If the game actually crashed then you have an 'exceptionLog.txt' file in your Rain World folder. If that is the case then proceed with the section BUG REPORTS.<br><br>[h3]Q4: My game actually crashed. What happened?[/h3]<br>A: Your game might have run out of memory. So far I haven't found a solution to this. As a workaround, I recommend that you restart your game from time to time (see KNOWN ISSUES).<br><br>[h3]Q5: Some adjacent camera textures don't match visually.[/h3]<br>A: This is a technical limitation. The camera textures are generated by the game (vanilla) and just stitched together by this mod. This means that the perspective of them don't match. In some cases it is more noticeable than in others.<br><br>[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*]Some snow related shaders don't work correctly. In some places there is more snow than in vanilla and in other places less. Falling snow can 'jump' when you would have changed screens.<br>[*]This mod increases memory consumption. When the game runs low on memory the performance will decline and the game might crash. This might take a while (90+ minutes). It is recommended to restart the game every now and then.<br>CONTEXT: There might be memory leaks or memory fragmentation. A memory leak would mean that memory is not released when it is not used anymore. Fragmentation might happen because most roomCamera textures are now fairly large and change in size often. This means that they need to be re-allocated in memory often and they require a chunk of memory without 'holes'.<br>[*]Shadows at the edge of the screen seem to flicker or stretch in some rooms. I can see the same thing without camera scroll. Maybe a vanilla bug.<br>[*]Motion sickness might be a problem. I wonder how much is due to noise (details) in the textures. You can play around with the parameters and see what works for you.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1]SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG[/h1]<br>See the [url=https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll]GitHub page[/url] for this mod.<br><br>[h1] OLDER VERSIONS [/h1]<br>You can download any version from:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll/releases<br><br>Follow the installation instruction from:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll?tab=readme-ov-file#installation<br>",

The constant help is, well, helpful.<br><br>[h1][b]Explosive Daddy Long Legs[/b][/h1]<br>This variant of Daddy Long Legs can utilize a hyper-mutation that allows it to create explosions at it's tentacles, in order to stun them and catch prey easier. So, try not to get caught, if you want to live.<br><br>This creature cannot currently spawn in the base game, and you will have to manually spawn it in using the Arena, Beastmaster, or Dev Console.

Try your best not to get caught off-guard by the electrifying properties of this version of Daddy.<br><br>Same as the ELL, this can't spawn naturally, ect., ect.

Right now, it only does things regarding the ZLL mainly because I was worried about small performance issues and the possible unfairness of one of it's abilities, since it could reach you off-screen in a multi-screen room. So I decided to just make it customizable so that everyone can decide for themselves what they want.<br><br>Have fun with this, and feel free to use it in your own mods if you want, as long this page is referenced somehow!",

This heavy slugcat, with their developed limbs, is exceptional at crawling, climbing, jumping and even throwing. However, they're clumsy at walking, so avoid standing up!<br><br>Poacher is the second new character of this mod. Their adversaries are far stronger and heavier than this slugcat, who is just a pup, so they must use their intellect and equipment to survive encounters rather than brute force.<br><br>Noir is currently the final character from Solace. Adopted from the mod Noircatto due to code similarity and friendship, he is most mobile on all fours, much like Friend. He can flip and dash around enemies, shredding them with his unique melee attacks. And, to get their attention, he can bait them with a unique vocalization...<br><br>Solace now adds quite a cast of characters, each with their own stories, personalities, and gameplay.

Please help by reporting weird behaviours.<br><br>Mod conflicts:<br>! Omnithrow and Aim Anywhere probably prevents this from working, please disable them as Aim Helper mod also provides the same ability of free aiming / vertical aiming.<br>!! Split-Screen mod is currently incompatible with the visuals module, it looks broken/duplicate visible lines but the actual snapping should work fine.<br><br>Ingame description:<br>Aim Helper allows you throw a weapon to any direction while holding direction inputs, if you release the inputs it defaults to horizontal.<br>Aim Helper also snaps your aim to a creature within customizable degrees of the throw direction.<br><br>I learned Rain World modding and c# just to make this mod, because I wanted to fix Omnithrow being sticky to the last input direction, and be able to do what Aim Anywhere does but with a Gamepad Controller instead of the mouse cursor.

(Basically 'aim smoothing')<br>* Per player toggle. (You get a checkbox, and they get a checkbox, everyone gets a checkbox)<br>* Check how it's possible to use advanced math for arc prediction.<br>* Check if it's possible to use devtools code for mouse input.<br>* Check how I can change spear properties on the fly to embed in ceilings and floors as if it was a backflipping throw.<br>* Put the mod on github, eventually, some day... (Lots of IRL events and priorities)<br><br>-Fixed missing screenshots that the Steam Workshop vanished mysteriously<br>Patch 5.0: Added legacy support for the older game version (v1.9.15b). (Special thanks to Slayer for helping me out)<br>Patch 4.9: Fixed the pointers that had broken with The Watcher game update. (They changed some creature name paths). Fixed an issue with visuals target background not displaying correctly.<br>Patch 4.8: Added option to hide direction line if there is a target.<br>Patch 4.7: Actually implement 'pointing always free aim' this time, even in vanilla mode. Refactored some internal pointers and checks<br>Patch 4.6: Added a check for avoiding snapping to friendly lizards and scavengers. Set direction color to also be the customized color.<br>Patch 4.5: Added new checks for camouflaged enemies and darkness.

"desc": "[h1]Introduction[/h1]<br>The Outsider is an overly flashy slugcat, or rather a distant relative of the slugcat. It possesses the genes of winged insects, which allows it to obtain biological fluorescence and flight ability, but also makes the Spore Puffs fatal to it.<br>﻿<br>1. The Outsider can fly. When in the air, hold down the jump button to flap your wings. The first flap of wings after each liftoff does not consume food points, but each subsequent flap will consume 1/4 of food points.<br>2. The Outsider can flare. When standing on the ground, holding down both the pick and jump buttons will consume 1 food point to release a flare.<br>3. The Outsider is a vegetarian animal. It cannot consume any meat, but as compensation, it can swallow more types of plants to obtain satiety, such as Bubble Weed, Flashbang, etc. [spoiler]But Spore Puffs is POISONOUS, and consuming it will immediately cause the outsider to die. Please don't blame it, there are no Spore Puffs in The Outsider's hometown, and The Outsider, like you, didn't know this at first.[/spoiler]<br>﻿<br>I hope you will find these abilities useful... because it has to try to survive in a dark and gloomy world.<br><br><br>[h1]Credits[/h1]<br>[h3]Code: [/h3]<br>Quaeledy<br>[h3]Art: [/h3]<br>Quaeledy<br>[h3]Other: [/h3]<br>Special thanks to Harvie and Pkuyo for their help and advice. Thanks to those who participated in the testing, they are: Wings Echo, ArcticTern, Fei, Fancy cat, Black Cat o.o, Xue Wan, Fi.<br>This is the first mod I wrote, so there may be many bugs that I haven't discovered yet. If you find it, please let me know. Apologize in advance for any possible bugs, hope you enjoy it!<br>﻿<br><br>[h1]Known issues[/h1]<br>1. Sometimes Jolly Coop will replace the character controlled by the player with a survivor. You only need to switch back to the outsider in the Jolly Coop.<br>2. Conflict with The BudGermination. Simultaneously enabling The Outsider and The BudGermination will result in The Outsider being disabled by the game.<br><br>﻿<br>[h1]Notes[/h1]<br>I used a translator to write this introduction, so there may be some descriptions that are incorrect.<br>You can customize its color in the JOLLY CO-OP. I made some modifications to the world map, and also modified the generation of creatures in each region to align them with the current timeline. But there are currently no new endings.<br>There are almost no new storylines. I am also considering the issue of balance, please don't worry.<br>The two rooms in the new area you saw by the warp menu are LTTM's rooms, which I used for testing. They are not the rooms I will eventually use.<br>This is the first mod I wrote, so there may be many bugs that I haven't discovered yet. If you find it, please let me know. Apologize in advance for any possible bugs, hope you enjoy it!<br>Additionally, I initially only wanted to play my own OC in the game, so I created this mod. Just to fit my OC timeline, I modified the world. So perhaps it won't achieve the completion level of the campaign in the game, please don't have too high expectations for it.<br>Due to Steam restrictions, I am unable to reply to comments. I am very sorry for this.<br>If you wish to create a video for this mod, you do not need my consent.<br><br><br>[h1]Updates[/h1]<br>[h3][2024.3.19][/h3]<br>Just bugs fixing and antenna dynamic optimization. This mod is my earliest work, full of various bugs. I want to complete it, but I lack time and energy, so please don't expect too much.<br>[h3][2024.8.19][/h3]<br>Just bugs fixing.<br>[h3][2024.10.27] ver 0.2.11[/h3]<br>1. Added Mothpups (Outsider pups). Mothpups can only be naturally generated and generated using the Dev Console on the timeline of Outsider, and can be generated using Beast Master on other lines and in sandbox modes;<br>2. Added DMS (Dress My Slugcat) adaptation for antennae, wings, and tail speckles for Outsider and Mothpup;<br>3. Added UI adaptation for Jolly-Coop;<br>4. Fixed the erroneous animations of flight and swallowtail.<br>[h3][2024.10.28] ver 0.2.12[/h3]<br>1. Added the “dressmyslugcat/outsidertemple” folder to the outsider mod folder as an example of using DMS to customize outsider parts.<br>2. Added an option in remix settings to make mothpups appear in other campaigns that can generate slugpups. Mothpups will replace other slugpups for generation, and you can customize the probability of this replacement.<br>[h3][2025.2.23] ver 0.2.13[/h3]<br>1. Fixed conflicts with Random Buff.<br>2. Modified the way Mothpup is generated using Dev Console. Now all you need to do is enter 'spawn Mothpup', and 'spawn SlugNPC' can no longer generate Mothpup.<br>3. Fixed the issue where Slugpup still has 1 satiety left at the beginning of the next cycle after starving and eating again (instead of deducting all satiety). (It should be noted here that this is Rain World's own problem, not The Outsider's problem.)<br>4. Improved Mothpup's pathfinding method.<br>[h3][2025.4.7] ver 0.2.14[/h3]<br>Support basic game v1.10.1.<br>[h3][2025.4.9] ver 0.2.15[/h3]<br>1. Fixed the issue in v1.10.1 where the prompt did not take effect.<br>2. Adjusted the horizontal flight speed in v1.10.1.<br>[h3][2025.4.10] ver 0.2.16[/h3]<br>1. Fixed the issue of Mothpup causing the game to freeze.<br>2. Attempt to fix the issue of Mothpup causing the game to not load.<br>[h3][2025.4.19] ver 0.2.17[/h3]<br>1. Balance adjustment. Modified the speed and altitude of the flight.<br>2. Added adaptation to new foods in The Watcher DLC:<br>(1) [spoiler]The Outsider has a lower probability of stun and a shorter duration of stun when consuming decaying plants, and can earn more food points.[/spoiler]<br>(2) [spoiler]The Outsider can directly gnaw on pomegranates without having to drop them to the ground and crack them.[/spoiler]<br>[h3][2025.4.19] ver 0.2.18[/h3]<br>1. Slightly adjusted takeoff speed and lateral descent speed.<br>2. Now the Remix configuration menu can configure the flight and flash buttons for players 1 to 4.<br>3. Now it is possible to set SwallowTail and its speckled sprites in DMS.<br>[h3][2025.4.21] ver 0.2.19[/h3]<br>1. Deleted some output logs belonging to The Outsider to reduce the impact on performance.<br>2. Added an adaptation to new creatures in The Watcher DLC: [spoiler]Big Moths[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Small Moths[/spoiler] are more friendly and tolerant towards The Outsider and Mothpups.<br>[h3][2025.8.14] ver 0.2.20[/h3]<br>Fixed the issue where the game froze when slugcat that was not The Outsider picked up Pomegranate.",

Many beasts are stronger than one may think however, so make sure to stay sharp in case they reawaken after mauling.<br>Now, the most important change, forcing the new gameplay style: <br>[b]You cannot throw spears.[/b] At all, which may cause some difficulties in combat and traversal...<br><br>[h1] Features [/h1] <br>This Owl-Approved mod contains:<br>[list]<br>[*] A new sub-region with wonderfully crafted new screens in Industrial Complex from myself and other region makers like Oscarriaq.

It's easy to remember, and it's close to what color Teensies actually are.<br><br>The Globox and Globox reskin use stilted sprites. This means they look taller, but have the same hitbox. This could cause long jumps to feel weird, and for his eyes to look a bit wonky(But when aren't they?).<br><br>Globox and Rayman skins use their head sprite for their chest pattern. This is so it can face and follow their prospective. If there's any modded weirdness occurring from this, it's not on me! (Such as being revived with the mod Revivify. This causes their chest pattern to dealign, but it's minor.)<br><br>I didn't add a Barbra costume, as she's not really 'Default' in Rayman Legends. That, and she would be a bit  C O M P L I C A T E D  to pixelate.<br><br>Speaking of not adding characters, I will not be adding Rabbids, as they don't appear in any mainline Rayman game.

I tried to fix it 3 times, but Rain World expects mostly symmetrical heads.<br><br>The Teensy costume works fine as a pup, for the most part. The arms detach when hanging from a pole however.<br><br>The 'Stun' state on the eyes/face of the grey scale costumes also reflect the chosen eye/face color when they are meant to be white. If the eye/face color is set to black or similar dark color, the 'Suprised' expression appears wrong.<br><br>Rayman is too cute, everything wants to eat him up.<br><br>______________________________________________________________<br>TROUBLESHOOTING -<br><br>If the costumes don't appear in game, here's a few things you can try.<br><br>* Get the Dress My Slugcat mod.<br>This mod is required for the reading and loading of the vast majority of cosmetic mods.<br><br>* Remember to enable your mods!<br>Hehe, I've done this before.<br><br>* Try reloading your atlases.<br>Within the 'Get Fancy' option on the main menu, there's a 'Reload atlases' button on the lower right of the screen.<br><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br><br>This mod does not add sound effects!

Whenever they try to bite, they release an slight shock that arcs between their teeth (in game this is shown as a one shot to most slugcats). As a side effect of the electricity, they are very energetic and are very fast.<br><br>[h1] Magenta Lizards [/h1](Time: Rivulet, Found anywhere with pink lizards. Can also be found in outer expanse in gourmand.)<br>Due to evolutionary pressure, some pink lizards have evolved into magenta lizards. These lizards are slightly stronger, faster and can see farther. Due to the dark coloration of the environment, they have evolved a much darker colo(u)ration. <br><br>[h1] Tangerine Lizards [/h1](Time: Spearmaster, Rivulet and Saint, Found in the Sky Islands and the Exterior)<br>A truly interesting lizard, the tangerine lizard exists as both a crossbreed between cyan and orange lizards and the ancestor of the two.

They will take more than a few spears to take down this lizard!<br><br>[h1] Sky Blue Lizard [/h1](Time: Rivulet, Found in Sky Islands and Industrial Complex.)<br>A evolution of blue lizards which have evolved gas propulsion in their tails due to dormant cyan genes. In addition they have quite a long tail and fast reflexes. They are quite a magnificent sight to behold!<br><br>[h1] Cherry Lizard [/h1](Time: Saint, Found in Silent Construct.)<br>An evolution of the strawberry lizards. They have inherited antennae due to orange heritage, and they hunt in groups. As a result of their slightly tinier, more rotund bodies, they can move very fast with their tongues. Due to all of this, they can surround prey quick and quickly attack those who harm the pack.<br><br>[h1] Raspberry Lizard [/h1](Time: Saint, Found in Silent Construct.)<br>A crossbreed between a red lizard and a strawberry lizard.

There are a number of limitations & bugs. Use at your own risk.[/h3]<br><br>[h3]Description[/h3]<br>A mod that adds Pokéballs. When a creature is hit with one, there's a chance it can be captured. When a ball hits a wall or other creature, the contained creature will release. Pokéballs have a 60% chance of spawning in scavenger treasuries. If a Pokéball spawns, theres a 20% chance for it to become a Greatball (increased capture chance), and a 1% chance for a Masterball (100% capture chance). Also watch out for scavengers, as they are expert Pokémon trainers (and will catch you). <br><br>Pokéballs will only tame creatures that are already tamable. <br>Needs Fisobs to work. Has an options menu. Also source code included for those who like spaghetti. <br>Spawn with Dev Console using this command: 'spawn_raw PokeballAbstract Greatball' <br><br>© Pokemon Pokeball belongs to Nintendo / Gamefreak / The Pokémon Company <br><br>[h3]Possibly in the future?[/h3]<br>- Break Pokéball if capture failed. <br>- Trading rare creatures with Scavengers to get higher reputation. <br>- More color/types of Pokéballs with different capture chances & features. <br>- Crafting Pokéballs as Gourmand? <br>- Pokémon battles with scavengers. Pokémon battle events? Free toll passthrough if player wins. <br>- Tame all creatures. (probably not because i think this is way too complex) <br>- Better Jolly Co-op support if possible. <br><br>[h3]Known bugs/issues[/h3]<br>- Slugpup relationships are removed entirely if they are kept in a Pokéball for too long, or during hibernation. Their food pips will first blink and later disappear. Release slugpups in shelters, or you need to get to know each other again as if you met for the first time. <br>- Creature relationships (if available) are not stored, instead they are reset to fully friendly. <br>- Releasing Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. <br>- Pokéball doesn't like rolling up slopes. It gets stuck on edges. <br>- If you time it right and throw a Pokéball at a DLL while it's eating, creatures can get stuck to DLLs in a unknown state upon release. <br>- Pokéball button light sometimes misaligned when carried. <br>- An exception might occur if a Pokéball hits certain projectiles mid-air (spitter spider dart). But this shouldn't cause problems afaik. <br>- Using Warp Menu will often change >something?< that will make you throw Pokéballs against yourself. <br><br>[h3]Player bugs/issues[/h3]<br>- Releasing a player from a Pokéball while there's a creature (Hazer) in its stomach freezes the game. <br>- Make sure players are not stuck in Pokéballs when hibernating, because that is counted as a player death. Restoring players after hibernating is undefined behavior. <br>- Getting carried into a den when you're inside a Pokéball won't trigger a death. You will need to manually restart. <br>- If you're stored in a Pokéball, and a scavenger carries you to a gate, the gate will actually activate, but the game will freeze. <br>- Pokéball camera tracking if player is stored is unreliable and doesn't work correctly with multi screen rooms. <br><br>[h3]Reporting[/h3]<br>Please report any bug, problem, change or feature request via the Discussions, or message me on the Rain World Discord ( https://discord.gg/rainworld ): @.maximol <br>If reporting a problem, also include the steps to recreate it & the following file(s): <br>- 'exceptionLog.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/exceptionLog.txt) <br>- 'LogOutput.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt) <br>",

The semi-plant cell structure allows it to perform photosynthesis in the wild, use the mimic tail to attract bat flies, and camouflage.<br><br>【Ability】<br>+ Photosynthesis: Staying in open-air areas in the wild can slowly restore satiety through photosynthesis.<br>+ Prey Attraction: Bat flies will be attracted and actively approach.<br>+ Mimic camouflage: When lying down or crawling forward, it will enter a hidden state, which is not easy to be found by predators in this state.<br>+ Karma protection: In the state of full food, long press ↑ + pick up button can consume all food to get a karma level protection.<br>+ Very cute: Similar is an unbelievably cute slugcat and suitable for everyone!!<br><br>【Other】<br>Similar was born on Sky Island and has weaker physical fitness. The timeline and environment of its current life are similar to those of Monk.<br>Mod will continue to be updated in the future, and Similar may have more new mechanisms, plots and more original content.<br>Thank you for your love and support for this mod, and welcome your comments and feedback.<br><br>【Known issues】<br>1.

New ability: eating karma flower can directly increase the level of karma under the condition of existing karma protection (you can choose to enable/disable on the configuration page)<br>2.

If you have better suggestions or changes, I will consider it when I have a higher level of programming (no.jpg)<br>If there is a bug (hope there will be less x), please try to bring the exceptionLog file in the root directory of the Rain World game, thank you!<br><br>From Carbontea:<br>Similar was originally the original slug cat oc I designed in 2018.<br>Similar is inspired by the red grass that can attract bat flies in the game, the mimic pole and some plants that hunt insects in reality. Because Rain World gives people the impression of danger, so I let this slug cat evolve the ability of mimicry and camouflage, and the semi-vegetative structure allows it to acquire the characteristics of photosynthesis and attracting bats.<br>I am very grateful to Teacher Xue Mian for making this design a reality after 5 years! I hope everyone likes Similar, anyway, I already like it to death.",

Fully credit to Ratrat44 for the mods used to make this possible![/b] <br><br><br>[h1] Current Lizards (in order) [/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*][b]Apple Lizard (RED_PINK)[/b]: Apple Lizards are predominantly pack hunters, but have been known to cooperate with Artillery Lizards. They possess a gall bladder able of producing a small amount of mucus per cycle, which they can spit in focused jets. However, this can leave them vulnerable to a counterattack.<br><br>[*][b]Artillery Lizard (RED_PINK)[/b]: Artillery Lizards were created as a purposed organism designed to curb creature counts. They are both heavily armoured and highly stun resistant, with the ability to distil fire powder bombs from within their own stomach.<br><br>[*][b]Blueberry Lizard (LIGHT_BLUE)[/b]: A lizard known to slugcats, originating from beyond the facility grounds. Blueberry lizards are passive towards slug cats, but are laughably weak and possess the ability to spit swallowed debris when in danger.<br><br>[*][b]Corpse Lizard (GREY)[/b]: Corpses reanimated by vast hordes of spiders, these bodies hunt to feed the hive inside them.<br><br>[*][b]Cicada Lizard (SQUIDCADA)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Dragon Lizard (HOT_PINK)[/b]: As a creature originating from the depths below the world, Dragon Lizards possess some dangerous traits. They can use void fluid stored in their stomach to fire a volley of firebug eggs each cycle, and are capable of propelling themselves through the air.<br><br>[*][b]Gator Lizard (SEAWEED)[/b]: A coastal variant of the green lizard, gators have stronger muscles and less weight, allowing them to climb poles and dive beneath the waves.<br><br>[*][b]Hive Lizard (RED_ORANGE)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Nightmare Lizard (PITCH_BLACK)[/b]: A lethal underwater predator, Nightmare lizards have adapted to the murky depths and only rely on touch and sound alone to navigate. Their lethal bite, acute hearing and the upper hand in the water should not be underestimated. [b]Oh yeah, and it's almost unkillable.[/b]<br><br>[*][b]Infant Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: An infant lizard known for its extreme aggression. They don't survive very long away from their mother.<br><br>[*][b]Mature Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: A slow-moving predator, capable of storing its young inside a pocket concealed within its mouth, not unlike a crocodile. It weaponises its children as a means to catch prey.<br><br>[*][b]Spitter Lizard (DARK_RED)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Spore Lizard (WHITE_GREEN)[/b]: A variant of lizard, overtaken by fungal spores. It has gained the ability to spit hardened pellets that explode in gas clouds, multiple times on impact. They tend to prey on insects, and will flee from any other creature it perceives as a threat.<br><br>[*][b]Fire Lizard (ORANGE)[/b]: With a diet of firebugs, fire lizards are a dangerous predator, being able to expel fire spears at an alarming rate.<br><br>[*][b]Infested Lizard (BROWN)[/b]: Victims of contaminated water in the vast wastes below Five Pebbles, Infested lizards are nothing more than hosts.<br>[/list]<br><br><br>[i]This is my first actual mod, so feedback is very much appreciated! <3[/i]",

Maybe. I couldn't replicate the bug, but I found what seemed to be the issue.

"desc": "My reinterpretations of canon slugcats are (very) slowly coming to life. Currently, only Artificer, Rivulet, Spearmaster, and their grayscale versions are available (with a bonus surprise).<br>They're based on various species of nudibranches mixed with a few other inspirations, for whom it may be interesting. <br><br>[b]PLEASE READ:[/b]<br>- This is my first time ever doing something like this. I'd love to hear what you guys think of this little passion project of mine. Also the skins might look goofy in specific poses, but it's bound to happen to anything more complex than a single color silhouette.<br><br>- Toggle asymmetry for every fancy tail texture. Recommended tail length about 6-8. Rivulet's tail looks best slimmer.<br><br>- Arti and Riv do not use extras (gills, scar).<br><br>- Spearmaster's grayscale skin shares the same face sprites as their colorful counterpart. Which means you have to set the face the same color as your body color. It's the way it is due to SM's long head, and most face sprites don't sit right on it in certain angles. I will change every skin accordingly once DMS layer function comes to existence.<br><br>- [strike]The rest of the slugcats will definitely come before the end of this summer. I'm just struggling with multiple other projects + personal worms in my brain.[/strike] UPDATE: things in life got a little rough, so I'm afraid I can't keep my promise. Oops!<br><br>[b]CURRENT PROGRESS OF THE UNRELEASED SKINS:[/b]<br>- Hunter and Gourmand are almost done, they're missing 50% of the head sprites.<br><br>- Survivor, Saint and Monk are close to being done, they're missing 80% of the head sprites.<br><br>- Nightcat and ??? are at early stages of making.",

This also allows them to jump slightly higher as well as sprint faster, though they are not as agile as the infamous Rivulet. It also means they can Squidcada Hover without needing to starve!<br><br>They start off with a natural glow that aids them through dark areas, as well as the Mark of Communication.<br>With the help of their extra arms, they are capable of throwing a spear that deals more damage than usual in order to defend themselves, which comes in handy when the world they find themselves in is littered with dangerous enemies...<br>Reputation is low and will need to be recovered manually.<br><br>They require 5 food to hibernate while being able to store 10 total. Plants give less food than usual, as they are mainly carnivorous. However, certain foods will fill much more hunger than usual, with their favorite food being Eggbug and Firebug Eggs and especially anything with a glow to it. When starving, their stats severely decrease to being comparable to The Monk.<br><br>Lastly, the Ascendant starts off in Rubicon, and currently uses Rivlet's worldstate.<br>[spoiler](Post-Rivulet, Pre-Saint.)[/spoiler]<br>[spoiler]If you happen to load the mod without Downpour, Ascendant will instead use Hunter's worldstate as a failsafe, starting in Shaded Citadel.[/spoiler]<br><br>[b][u]I highly recommend you set the tail settings to the following in Dress My Slugcat, for the best experience:[/u]<br>[i]Asymmetry<br>5 to 6 Length<br>2.0 Wideness<br>0.1 Roundness[/i][/b]<br><br><br>[h1]Known Issues[/h1]<br>- Characters are only capable of achieving the ascending endings, as no custom campaigns are made for them.<br>- Characters may be a bit unbalanced at the moment, I'm tweaking these constantly. Ascendant specifically will have a major nerf once their crafting is added.<br>- Sometimes certain sprites appear to white out into triangles, this may be a Dress My Slugcat issue. Reloading Atlases or reinstalling the mod tends to fix this.<br>- Custom spawns are unfinished, check the mods change notes to know which ones have custom spawns for now. I'll remove this note once all regions are finished.<br>- Sea Serpent does not naturally spawn anywhere in the current patch, but can be used in Arena Mode.<br>- [spoiler]Two modified versions of the Blue Lizard are accessible in Arena Mode, these are meant to be used for The Copycat's campaign which will begin once spawns for The Ascendant are finished.[/spoiler]<br><br><br>[h1]To Do[/h1]<br>- [strike]Add Arena Mode sprites.[/strike]<br>- [strike]Add unique in-game sprites.[/strike]<br>- Add Death artwork.<br>- [strike]Add Sleeping artwork.[/strike]<br>- Add Ascended artwork.<br>- [strike]Add Title Screen artwork.[/strike]<br>- [strike]Add Selection Screen artwork.[/strike]<br>- Add Custom Ascension Ending cutscene.<br>- [u][b]Finish adding custom spawns to every Region[/b][/u].<br>- Give Ascendant limited crafting for void/light based objects.<br><br><br>[h1]Future playables[/h1]<br>- The Vorpal?<br>- The Siren?<br>- The Copycat?

Since the mod doesn't have any mechanic dependencies from Downpour yet, it is theoretically possible to play it with the base game. Though I highly recommend against this as it will probably only cause the mod to break later on once abilities such as crafting are added.",

Includes options to pause, destroy, duplicate, tame, stun, teleport, cut/paste, safari-control, kill & revive individual creatures, players and objects. Also allows you to activate and throw items like bombs and spears. Press right mouse button on an object or the background to open one of two radial menus. Hold left control (default) to select multiple objects, or to use a selection-rectangle. While dragging use the scroll wheel to rotate objects. <br><br>Credits:<br>- Fyre & Noir for the BeastMaster menu trianglemesh code <br>- IdleFire Guardian for playtesting <br>- heerxingen for Simplified Chinese translation <br>- CreativeGamer03 for help with DeepL placeholder translations <br><br>Source code is here: https://github.com/woutkolkman/mousedrag <br>If you see any mistakes in the translations you'd like to see fixed, it would be helpful to create a pull request with corrections for the translation file: https://github.com/woutkolkman/mousedrag/tree/master/MouseDrag/bin/mousedrag/text <br><br>[h3]Known issues/bugs[/h3]<br>- Pausing a deer while you're on it will make you slide off. You need to jump to be able to move again. <br>- When cut/pasting a player in/to arena, if there's a creature in their stomach (Hazer), it is deleted. This happens because of limitations when deserializing a creature. <br>- When cut/pasting objects, many objects will ignore the new position and spawn back on their old position in a new room. This is determined by how the object is programmed. <br>- Cut/pasting Oracles (iterator puppets) has a VERY HIGH chance of crashing the game. Also, their sprites will not be removed immediately. <br>- Pasting Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. <br>- If Jolly Co-op is enabled in story-mode, you cannot safari-control slugpups or follow slugpups with the RoomCamera. <br>- After returning from a safari-controlled creature and the player room was reloaded, you cannot open your map. Jolly Co-op will keep the player's room loaded and prevent this from happening. <br><br>[h3]Reporting[/h3]<br>Please report any bug, problem, change or feature request via the Discussions, or message me on the Rain World Discord ( https://discord.gg/rainworld ): @.maximol <br>If reporting a problem, also include the steps to recreate it & the following file(s): <br>- 'exceptionLog.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/exceptionLog.txt) <br>- 'LogOutput.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt) <br>",

They can also pull spears out of walls, regardless of if the Remix setting is enabled or not. Estranged is immune to explosives.[/spoiler]<br>[spoiler]If their foodbar is completely full, they are able to switch to the charged state. This process takes multiple seconds, spends all of their food pips and stuns them briefly.[/spoiler]<br>[spoiler]When in the charged state, they become faster and leap much farther than before, but their foodbar drains passively. If the Estranged runs out of food for too long, they will die.[/spoiler]<br>[spoiler]Their explosive abilities also become more powerful; their concussive blast gains the ability to damage creatures and they gain a the ability to release a more powerful explosion, at the cost of two food pips.[/spoiler]<br>[spoiler]They are unable to access the map or rain timer.[/spoiler]<br><br>The next features are not yet implemented into the tutorial, so I will list them here instead.<br><br>Estranged is able to consume explosives. If they consume an explosive whilst charged, it grants them extra time before their food is drained. If they consume an explosive whilst not charged, it will temporarily increase pyro capacity. If they consume an explosive whilst burnt out, it removes that status effect.<br>Estranged can switch back fron being charged under the same conditions that they could become charged.

For unknown reasons, you have fallen from the cosmic space onto this planet, where the Rain World is unfolding, temporarily losing most of your cosmic abilities. You need to visit the echoes of the ancestors and collect fragments of stars to regain your lost abilities and find a way back to the universe.<br><br>Features:<br><br>The cosmic ghost has the ability to create cosmic items and manipulate time and space.<br>All skills have related settings in the mod config interface.<br>Unique ending.<br><br>Starting Abilities:<br><br>1. Starrealm Spear Crafting:<br>Spend 1 hunger to convert any spear into a Starrealm Spear using cosmic energy. The Starrealm Spear can instantly kill any creature it hits and reverts to a normal spear after use.<br>2. Singularity Bomb Crafting:<br>Spend 2 hunger to combine two rocks into a Singularity Bomb using cosmic energy. The user is immune to the effects of the Singularity Bomb.<br>3. Ghost Form:<br>In situations with zero gravity, the character transforms into a semi-transparent ghost form, immune to the influence of any creatures or the environment.<br><br>Abilities to Restore:<br><br>1. Gravity Control:<br>Unlocked upon when you saw five pebbles, it allows you to spend 1 hunger to change the gravity in the current room for 30 seconds. If you change rooms, the new room will also be affected.<br>2. Time Freeze:<br>Unlocked when reaching the maximum Gravitational Force limit. Activating this ability immobilizes all creatures except for yourself for approximately 6 seconds, with a cooldown of 45 seconds.<br>3. Space Teleportation:<br>A new element involving the collection of Star Fragments, similar in appearance to sandbox collectibles. After collecting one in each area, you unlock the ability to set teleportation gates in the current area. These gates allow you to teleport between areas with a cooldown of 30 seconds and a 6-second activation delay, during which you can be interrupted by other creatures.<br>4. Time Reversal:<br>Unlocked after collecting all Star Fragments in every area. When activated, time starts to reverse, and the states of objects and creatures revert to previous conditions. This can be triggered after death and can be used multiple times in one cycle, depending on the current Gravitational Force level.<br>5. Space-Time Travel:<br>Aquired after completing the ending. You can travel to other slugcats' timeline including modded ones.<br><br>Upcoming Features:<br><br>Exclusive dialogues<br>Quality of life updates<br><br>Creator:<br><br>Hani: Character Owner, Planning, Story Design<br>Pkuyo: Programming (commission)<br>Notocorda: Art, Character Design<br><br>Thanks Lolight2 for the introductory video!<br>Thanks snoodle for the mast region!<br><br>Upgraded to 1.1, fixing some bugs, please see change note for details.<br>Upgraded to 2.0, adding plot, new ability and ton of things, please see change note for details.",

It is mainly cosmetic, but it will also serve to call back a certain OC npc if they are wandering too far.<br>*PetCat has elevated speed and jumping, but weakened throwing strength.<br><br>*Wild slugcats can be found around the map.<br>*PetCat passively emits a lizard scent that causes all other slugcats to behave fearfully/hostilely towards them (as insurance for Unparalleled Innocence that PetCat wouldn't just run off and join a colony). Lizards are also more aggressive, some are confused by the scent and view PetCat as a rival for territory.<br>*A lizard companion npc that PetCat finds on their travels (originally thought about giving her a pup to care for, but a few mods have already have companion pups).<br><br>*Three new regions that link up between Unparalleled Innocence and Waterfront Facility.<br>*Three new creatures (all predators).<br>*Unique dialogue with Moon, Five Pebbles, and of course Unparalleled Innocence.<br>*Two unique endings (cannot ascend).",

Also trans rights!!!<br><br>Note: Camera Scroll is a known incompatibility. If you have any other issues with the region, make sure you take them to the Official Rain World Discord for troubleshooting.

(note: the longer they are a scug the more they forget about this previous life).<br><br>(Regular part)<br>After her new slugcat family was killed while her body was still in childhood, she was adopted by scavengers for some time before eventually being sent to live with the first responsible slugcats they found.<br><br>Her first relationship went well, and she was gifted her bracelet from her lover, and all was well until her lover ended her own life. She decided to travel to avoid the bad memories, eventually finding another slugcat colony, where she met a new partner, this one male, and they became life mates, her partner gifting her the purple pearl necklace.<br><br>They had four children: a boy, a pair of twin boy and girl, and finally a girl. Her youngest child, disabled from birth, wore a red scarf. She eventually got so focused caring for everyone else that she ended up accidentally neglecting her eldest, who then disappeared to tame a huge number of lizards. She left a note in his room apologising and asking to make amends.<br><br>One day, she went hunting for the colony's food, only to find the entire colony killed at the hands of lizards - controlled by her scorned eldest son. As she walked back into the colony, she saw the remains of her youngest, and took her scarf to wear in her memory. Every step over the corpses of family and friends felt like walking on blades. She decided that the only way to curb her son's rage would be to silence him herself.<br><br>She saw him reading the note, a pained expression on his face, then he looked up to her, as she was standing over him with a menacing aura. During their ensuing battle, she gained what would become many of her scars, and the rare acid-spitting lizards her son had in his pack were able to sear her right eye off with acid...<br><br>...but in doing so, she manifested the power to create a Soul Harpoon.<br>She used her new weapon, forged from the souls of her loved ones she had now realised she had absorbed, to slay the lizards and her son, and decided that the only way to spare herself of this pain would be to give up on relationships entirely. Along this path, she developed a hatred and hunger for lizards. (note: this hatred is not as severe as Artificer's hatred of scavs).<br><br>The scavengers around her gave their utmost respect, branding the mark of the Dragon Slayer into her arms as a ceremonial status symbol. She would later find a lost slugpup, adopting it for her own, but was unable to save them when they ran towards scavengers curiously... with a spear in their hands. The scavengers immediately regretted striking the pup down when they saw her, though she refused to kill them despite her hurt and their offers to die in retribution, as she understood why. A pack of lizards appearing left her with only one option for escape - throwing her child's corpse as an edible distraction.<br><br>She blames herself for everything.<br><br>and there yah gooo!!<br><br>BUT PLEASE SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS AND PEOPLE WHO MADE THE ART SHOWCASED IN THE MOD!

Does not like fairy lizards.<br>BugLizard - A small insect-like lizard that shoots beehives, will eat grass lizards.<br>DragonLizard - A big lizard that are usually in open areas. Get in line of sight and you're dead.<br>FairyLizard - A friendly lizard that shoots balls of light(flashbang but this is cooler).<br>FightingLizard - Basically a red lizard but redder and meaner without the tongue and spit ability.<br>FlyingLizard - A lizard that can fly across rooms, gave me a jumpscare before.<br>GhostLizard - A pale lizard that doesn't do much but most creatures are afraid of it.<br>GrassLizard - A fluffy lizard that shoots puffballs, great insect killer (yes ik bug is supposed to have advantage). Hunted by Bug Lizards.<br>GroundLizard - A dirty lizard that can charge at you(I think?) and spit mud(not really mud) to push you off poles.<br>IceLizard - A big cold lizard that are usually in the winter. Can slide across rooms quickly if nothing is in the way.<br>MysteryLizard - ???<br>PoisonLizard - Can put its opponents to sleep.<br>PsychicLizard - Has leap and antennae ability, can also shoot void bullets.<br>RockLizard - A sturdy lizard that shoots rocks, high tendency to lounge.<br>SteelLizard - An even more sturdy lizard that.... shoots rocks very fast. (I like to think of it as bullets and that it's a machine gun, I'd put spears instead but Underhang is hard enough as it is.)<br>NormalLizard - A small and basic lizard that lounges at its prey from short distances, has good hearing.

"desc": "This mod adds two new lizards (Fanged Lizard and Great Fanged Lizard) inspired by the great Girros and Girros from Monster Hunter.<br>This breed of social lizards have mastered the paralyzing venom that they can inject into their prey through their disproportionate fangs to make it difficult for them to fight back once they have been bitten. Despite this, fanged lizards are quite cowardly, running or evading any creature that exceeds them in size even if they are in pack.<br>However, everything changes when they have a Great fanged lizard with them, being the equivalent of the alpha male of the specie, despite being slower and stupider than their small counterpart, It makes up for it with a greater ferocity, resistance and a much more powerful paralyzing venom that allows it to confront even vultures, even it roar is much more powerful, allowing it to command their entire pack and giving them a security and ferocity that makes them even more aggressive than the Great fanged lizard themselves, they have also learned to infuse their saliva with their venom, so be very careful.<br>Right now they don't appear naturally so I recommend using the Modded Unlocks or BeastMaster mod to use them, I also have to tell you that this is my first time creating a mod with Fisobs so it may have compatibility problems.<br>If anyone wants to put them in a custom region, don't be shy about asking me.<br>I hope you like them!<br><br>'this mod was possible thanks to M4rbleL1ne help'<br><br><br>Future additions or changes:<br>[list]<br>[*] Custom sounds (when I learn to do it and implement them XD).<br>[*] Add a power up version of the great fanged lizard.<br>[/list]",

But I believe Aang can save the world.'<br><br>This mod includes:<br>- Aang<br>- Katara<br>- Sokka<br>- Toph<br>- Zuko<br>- Marks based on the element symbols<br><br>- For Zuko and Aang you should probably use the assymetry tail!<br>- For Katara and Sokka I recommend using custom tail size to make it look more like a tailfin<br>- Toph's face disconnects when she faces head down, this is normal (can't figure out how to fix it), she is just too powerful to obey the laws of physics.<br><br>Requirements: - Dressmyslugcat",

However this all happens in the background.<br>WebPs require less CPU but might take a bit longer.<br>So even if you were to die or quit to the menu the GIF/WebP should still generate and will eventually appear in your selected output directory.<br>You can even export up to 3 GIFs/WebPs at the same time, however this can take quite some time and each generating GIF needs around 1-2GB RAM depending on your settings.<br><br>[hr][/hr]<br>Using the default controls (can all be rebound in the mods config menu) the mod can be used in the following way:<br>Press '[b]I[/b]' to open instant replay, it will now play the last X seconds starting at the beginning of the recording.<br>You will know when the replay viewer is active (especially in fullscreen mode) via the icon in the top right<br>Toggle between fullscreen and popup mode with the '[b]F[/b]' key while the player is active.  <br>While the replayer is open you can pause with the '[b]P[/b]' key or by pressing either the [b]right or left arrow key[/b]. Press '[b]P[/b]' again to enter play mode.  <br>The current state (playing/paused) is indicated via an icon in the top right of the player.   <br>Using the arrow keys you can now go forward (right arrow key) and backwards (left arrow key). Tapping a key shortly will go frame by frame while holding will fast forward/rewind.  <br>By pressing the '[b]E[/b]' key the current frame will be exported as .png to the part defined in the options menu (defaults to 'Rain World' folder in your pictures folder).",

In the future, I plan to add slugcat campaigns.<br><br>I hid all spoilers, but I'll warn you anyways.<br><br><br><br>Description of regions:<br><br>-Forgotten Pathway (In the code it is FO): [spoiler] An old emergency route that had been cut off during Looks To The Moon's collapse. This branch connected Five Pebbles, Looks To The Moon, and drainage system. Some say that this flooded path is now barely functioning due to the rarefraction cell... [/spoiler]<br><br>-Mechanical Ocean (Not added yet): [spoiler] An ancient ocean with purposed organisms ruling supreme. This large body of water goes extremely deep and introduces new creatures of the dark. Who knows what you'll find down there... [/spoiler]<br><br><br><br>Descriptions of Slugcat Campaigns: (Please no blaming me for my campaigns' similarity. I had the idea before I knew anything about the other campaigns)<br><br>-The Fathomless: [spoiler] A slugcat with one goal: Save Looks To The Moon before she shuts down entirely. This slugcat takes place right after Saint as a separate timeline of what would happen if Saint failed. The snow kept getting deeper, and Looks To The Moon's rarefraction cell was not enough to keep out the cold. She finds the Fathomless, a slugcat unable to stay on land for too long. The Fathomless understands her situation and searches even deeper below Looks To The Moon's submerged superstructure. (The region will be called Mechanical Ocean, and I will add it once I start working on the slugcats). The Fathomless will search for all of Looks To The Moon's lost rarefraction cells, and will hopefully come back in one piece. There are dangerous and unforeseen creatures in those ocean depths. [/spoiler]<br><br>-The Forgotten: [spoiler] 'In the beginning, there was darkness. In the end, there will be light.' A slugcat is trying its best to survive in changing times. A new cycle has started at the tail end of the ice age. One of complete darkness. This Slugcat is completely blind, and I will try to implement things like echolocation that reveals your location to the creatures of the dark. [/spoiler]<br><br><br><br>I will try to add music all made by me, but I might not get to that.<br><br>Future Plans:<br>-Two slugcats with unique story-lines. I have come to realize that other campaigns come close to my own. I assure you that I came up with these ideas on my own and I am not copying anyone else. I'm really sorry if your mod is like mine.<br>-More rooms, more regions!<br>-Connect my region to the actual world.<br>-Custom music<br>-Custom creatures.<br>-Custom endings, cut-scenes, and maybe dreams.<br><br>This is my first mod and I would really appreciate any help or suggestions you have.<br><br>Warning;<br>-Forgotten Pathway's karma gate is not only non-functional but also crashes on use.<br>-This region is a W.I.P. and is subject to constant updates.<br>-I have other things to do with my life so I might not answer comments immediately.<br>-Adding slugcats might be too difficult for me, because I don't know C#. Don't hold your breath for these campaigns. I might just end with the two regions.<br>-Sorry for the lack of backgrounds in my rooms. I'm definately not going to re-render rooms FO_A01 to FO_A03. I've given up on those ones. I'm going to fix the random cliff in FO_A04 tho.<br><br><br>Good News:<br><br>-I'm currently working on the slugcats. (Majorly confusing tho. I'm bad at programming.) ",

"desc": "This mod provides more graphical layers you can use when editing the Sofanthiel Dating Simulator. It adds two new spots for graphics to spice up the look of your mod. And another action to control the music.<br><br>HOW TO USE:<br>If you don't already know how to edit the visual novel, it's VERY easy to reverse engineer. Just go into the 'content' folder of the More Slugcats Expansion files (C:rogram Files (x86)teamteamappsommonain WorldainWorld_DatatreamingAssetsodsoreslugcatsontent). All the files involved in the Dating Simulator (except for the code) are in there. Make sure to also head to the Modding Wiki to learn about the basics of Rain World modding in general.<br>Now that you either already know or just figured out how to mod the Dating Simulator, in order to use the new changes, the text files that you add must end with '_exp.txt'. If they don't, it won't use the modified engine and nothing will happen. So, if your mod has a file named 'modstart.txt', it must be changed to 'modstart_exp.txt'.<br>Now for the new graphic layers, it works like the two portraits for the Inv and the other slugcat. The lines in the text file for the new layers are just under those for the originals. I call them 'overlay' (3rd line) and 'textbar' (4th line). The anchor point (aka middle) for overlay is in the center of the screen and textbar's center is on the middle point of the dialogue text. You can guess the original purpose for them by their names, there's even some assets provided for textbar in this mod's files, check them out or create your own. But feel free to use them however you wish.<br>Now for the new music command: Mute. If you put 'MUTE' in the music control line of the text file, instead of doing a smooth fade to silence, the track that's currently playing will abruptly stop when the file is loaded. That's it.<br><br>If you are still confused, check out my other mod (Hunger Games Simulator), it's where the code originally came from. Feel free to snoop around the files of that mod for examples.<br>And if you would like to contact me, here's my Discord username:<br>@jrthekidRS",

Use an explicit cast instead, or construct one before logging.<br>- More ways to log formatted messages (especially with color data included)<br>- Improved support for logging to console with colored text.<br>- Now uses an InterpolatedStringHandler for processing colors. <br>- Test attributes will work with any access modifier (previously public only).<br>- Boolean compare operators now work on Condition structs.<br>- Patcher version updated to 1.0.4.1<br>- Patcher update process changed to ensure VersionLoader is always working while the patch is applied.<br>- Fix development build failing to compile.<br>- Fix non-test related asserts impacting test assert count.<br>- Better handle log requests from external logging APIs.<br>Version 1.0.0<br>- Watcher release compatibility<br>- Fix challenge filtering.

Still unresolved for Expedition, which would only affect restrictions involving equivalent regions.<br>Version 0.9.83<br>- Implement Custom Shelter detection option. Custom regions may now serve as reliable spawn locations in Expedition.<br>- Allow settings to be saved, enabled through Remember My Settings.

Leaving NSH's room will cause the game to crash. <br>2. In [Collection], if you unlock all collections in MSC settings and click on the broadcast of NSH region that was not collected in the game, it will cause the game to crash. (This seems to be an issue from CRS)<br>3. When using the Warp Menu to teleport to the SB-OE karma gate, attempting to teleport to the gate in the OE region before attempting to teleport to the gate in the SB region will cause the game to report an error and fail to teleport.<br>4. This mod also considers Lancer's hunter as the Hunter. <br>5. Gates Scanner will cause [spoiler]a pearl in a performance of this mod to move to the wrong position[/spoiler], but this is not very important.<br>6. When viewing the map of NSH region in the [Region] menu, the slugcat avatar will display incorrectly.<br>7. When both Guardian and Palette Creator are enabled simultaneously, an error will be reported, but it will not affect the game process.<br>8. Sometimes, when you have played for too long, the game may crash when playing the new ending scenes. Afterwards, you can reopen the game and continue playing normally, although you may miss the scenes of the new ending.<br>9. The reason is not yet clear, however, Slugcats whose OE has collapsed may not be able to trigger the road to NSH. It may be related to mod conflicts.<br><br><br>[h1]Bug Fix: [/h1]<br>1. Some translation errors have been corrected.<br>2. Fixed the issue where swallowing a pearl in the second dream caused the game to crash.<br>3. Fixed the issue where players who were killed by NSH would be killed by NSH if they entered any save again.<br>4. Fixed some issues that occurred on Daddy Long Legs.<br>5. Fixed an issue where entering a room containing SuperStructure Fuses but not belonging to any region would cause the game to freeze.<br><br><br>[h1]Notes: [/h1]<br>1. I am considering modifying the English translation first, and after the English modification is completed, I will add translations from other languages. This requires your help, if you are willing (because I am not familiar with other languages). (Good news: Someone is already helping to modify the English translation!)<br>2. Until a reasonable setting is obtained, I will not consider allowing other slugcats to reach NSH temporarily (although you can indeed find that I have done related content when using Warp Menu to reach NSH)<br>3. This mod can be used in both v1.9.07b and v1.9.15 of the game. <br>[b]If you are in version 1.9.15, it is best to re subscribe to this mod and its predecessor mods to ensure updates. Additionally, it is best to disable this module first and then reapply it.[/b] I'm not sure how many bugs it has now. If you encounter a bug, please let me know. [b]Additionally, without exceptionLog.txt (see Bug Reports), I would hardly be able to do anything about the bugs.[/b]<br><br><br>[h1]Updates: [/h1]<br>[h3][2024.6.5] ver 1.0.8[/h3]<br>1. Updated the English translation text.<br>2. Rewrote the method of reading conversations. Now NSH can support custom conversations for mod slugcats, and if you want to see an example, please check the text folder of The Outsider.<br>[h3][2024.10.27] ver 1.1.0[/h3]<br>1. Added a method to go to NSH for Slugcats after Hunter. (only in story mode now)<br>(Condition: [spoiler]Use Hunter to have Moon repair the aquamarine pearl.[/spoiler] )<br>(Tip: For Slugcats whose OE has not collapsed, [spoiler]use the fixed pearl to pass through the SB-OE gate.[/spoiler] For Slugcats whose OE has collapsed, [spoiler]jump off the cliff.[/spoiler])<br>2. Added behavior and dialogue for NSH when Hunter carries Slugpup.<br>3. Enriched NSH's behavior. For example, the behavior of closing eyes after NSH has been ascended has been added.<br>4. Distinguish neurons for NSH, and add Moon's interpretation of NSH neurons.<br>5. Added NSH's interpretation of Moon's neurons, FP's neurons, FlyLure (Batnip), and SporePlant (Beehive).<br>6. Added the reaction of NSH when players eat neurons in front of NSH.<br>7. Allow adding custom mod Pearl dialogues for NSH.<br>8. Added interpretation of the aquamarine pearl in the timeline of other slugcats for Moon.<br>9. Added NSH response to players throwing Singularity Bomb.<br>10. Some bug fixes.<br>(Attention: Some of the new content is translated into English using machine translation, which may result in biased meanings. Subsequent updates will correct this.)<br>[h3][2024.11.6] ver 1.1.0[/h3]<br>1. Expanded the trigger range for Slugcats whose OE has collapsed [spoiler] to jump off cliffs to NSH[/spoiler].<br>2. Attempt to fix the issue where other slugcat dreams cannot be triggered.<br>[h3][2025.2.14] ver 1.1.1[/h3]<br>1. Added Spanish translation.<br>2. Added custom pearls in the NSH area to the [Collection].<br>3. Some bug fixes.<br>[h3][2025.2.16] ver 1.1.2[/h3]<br>Fixed the issue where Gourmand, Survivor and Monk were unable to [spoiler]use the pearl to open the SB-OE gate when the SB-OE was not opened in Gourmand’s campaign[/spoiler].<br>[h3][2025.4.7] ver 1.1.3[/h3]<br>Support basic game v1.10.1.<br>[h3][2025.4.9] ver 1.1.4[/h3]<br>Fixed the issue in v1.10.1 where the game opening prompt did not take effect.<br>[h3][2025.4.10] ver 1.1.5[/h3]<br>1. Fixed the issue of game freezing when entering a dream mode in multiplayer games.<br>2. Fixed the issue of game freezing and lost save files caused by hibernation after crossing regions. This issue may be related to EmgTx or Warp Menu, and I may not be able to completely fix it in the short term (currently non essential items may be lost in the shelter).<br>[h3][2025.8.21] ver 1.1.7[/h3]<br>1. Fixed conflicts with the 'Chasing Wind' mod. Now [spoiler]the cycle assigned to the hunter by Chasing Wind[/spoiler] will be correctly counted.<br>2.

For the problem of time and energy, most of the English text uses machine translation, please forgive me.<br>3.

That's my biggest regret.<br><br><br>[Special ability]<br>Branch control: simultaneously hold down 'Pick up' 'jump' or hold down 'down' 'pick up' 'jump' to perform branch control, press 'jump' to cancel. This will give you the bullet time to use it (which can be cancelled in the mod configuration screen), but you can't make any moves during this time.<br>You can use the branch to pick up objects, store objects, and convert the health bar of other creatures into your own food bar.<br>Making long branch: Long press 'Up' and 'Pick' to consume 1 food bar to make a long branch, which can be thrown to hang on the wall and climb by custom buttons.<br>Remove corruption: You can kill corruption by touching them and press 'Pick' with branch, or remove them by touching corruption walls. (Long press 'Pick')<br>Level of corruption: There is an extra bar below food bar to indicate your level of corruption. Be careful not to let it turn completely red! Something bad is going to happen!!)<br><br>(More detailed instructions on the use of branch control (to prevent some people who can't touch it themselves will mistake it for a bug)<br>Press 'Pick' to pick up object, long press 'Pick' on creatures (you need to hold down) to convert their health into your food bar, press 'Throw' to cancel picking up objects or grabbing creatures, 'Jump' to quickly cancel the branch control and put the object held by the branch into your hand <br>If you are grabbing a creature, press 'Throw' to unattach the creature, then 'Jump' to retrieve the branch <br><br>Attention:<br>1.The BudGermination cannot store an object by swallowing it<br>2. Most bugs, centipedes, and spiders are fatal to it<br>3. You can eat most living things except bugs, centipedes, spiders, and eel lizards.<br>4. You can't pick up or grab most bugs, centipedes, spiders, etc<br>5. Karma flowers have additional effects<br>6.

"desc": "IM SO SORRY THE GIFS ARE THAT BAD, I WILL MAKE BETTER ONES SOON, I JUST DONT KNOW HOW TO DO RW GIFS LIKE OTHERS D':<br><br>This is a seperate mod for skins related to comunity made slugs. I feel its better to separate them from my main pack witch has ocs. Pls color the slugcat with white for the best results. All leg sprites are edited from Miimows Artstyle Legs.<br><br>We all have seen people give their takes on the main slugs, many different cool desings and gimics. But now, I feel the community and their slugs also need some shine! In SAPat Community Slugs you will get playable desings for those slug campains that you love! Hope you enjoy my takes of the characters and dont worry, there are plans on making more skins for other slugies.<br><br>What skins are done in this pack + desing fun facts:<br><br>Gravel eater: From Max's mod, a chonker dragon like slug with a mouth that can destroy any rock, made to do so. Spiky in nature to reflet his endurance.<br>Beacon: From Luzard's mod, the tail sprite is based on a misunderstanding from me in Beacon's menu art, making me think the flashbang plant was her tail, so I added that to the desing.<br>Photomaniac: Also from Luzard's mod, a spiky and bring fella to reflect his ability to explode! Another Fun fact, you can find these same Pitch Black skins in the official mod.<br>Technomancer: From Niko's mod, spiky in similar nature to Photo with a similar premace. Sadly this skin does not look nice with the Techy mod since there are fur sprites that go on top of the DMS :(. Lets hope that gets fixed tho.<br><br>Planned future fellas:<br><br>Escord: The base desing and all other desings that come with their different builds.<br>The Lost: If I remenber correcly that was a centy slug fellow, that will be fun to desing jeje.<br>Incandescent: Funny flame guy<br><br>If yall have any community made slugs that I could do a desing for please leave it down below! Hope I have the time to do as much as I can.",

A 'tick' in this case means a single physics step for the game's simulation. While these are often called 'frames', it's important to rememeber these are distinct from graphical frames, so I prefer the term 'tick'.<br><br>In vanilla Rain World, the tickrate is 40 ticks/second, occasionally modified in-game (most commonly by eating a mushroom, being near an Echo, or being in the Depths). Cordyceps allows you to manually cap the tickrate at any value from 1 to 40 Hz. The speedrun/file timer is automatically adjusted to ignore Cordyceps' own slowdown, but still responds normally to vanilla tickrate changes.<br><br>Keybinds for the various functions are configurable in the Remix menu, but are set to the following by default:<br>- Show/hide info panel: [M]<br>- Toggle tickrate cap: [Comma]<br>- Increase tickrate cap: [Equals]<br>- Decrease tickrate cap: [Minus]<br>- Toggle pause: [Period]<br>- Tick advance: [Forward Slash]<br>- Reset tick counter: [Semicolon]<br>- Pause/unpause tick counter: [Single Quote]<br><br>Pressing and holding the increase/decrease tickrate cap keys will make them rapidly change value, so you don't have to repeatedly press them over and over.<br><br>[h2]Note on the Tick Advance Function[/h2]<br>Tick advance can only be used while the game is paused with Cordyceps, and does not work by immediately forcing the next tick to run. Instead, it simply unpauses the game until the next tick occurs, then automatically pauses it again for you. Any inputs you want to occur on the tick you advance to should be held down while you press the tick advance key.<br><br>[h2]OBS Integration[/h2]<br>Cordyceps can, with the help of a companion plugin called Cordyceps-stalk, integrate with OBS and add additional features. Please see the OBS.md file that comes with this mod for more details.<br>",

And also because i wanted to make something for the community. (And also because nobody has given a scug a knife before to my knowledge >:3).<br><br>They have a special ability called bloodlust that makes them even stronger and also gives them a few supernatural abilities (like making their knife return upon being thrown and cheating death), this is also configureable. To activate hold up + pickup while having at least 4 food pips (default).<br><br>He will spawn in howling rifts if its installed otherwise he will spawn in shaded citadel.<br><br>If the knife is lost it will spawn on the next cycle for all murderers.<br><br>-<br>This mod will likely be remade at some point in the future, there are quite a few things im not happy with that could be better, like the art or the code (or even the iterator interactions), that makes me wanna remake into a mod i will definitely not cringe at in the future :).<br><br>Im also making a new slugcat with an interesting ability for a separate mod in the future (it'll be a more serious mod this time :3).<br>-<br><br>--This mod is only tested in linux with proton but should work fine in windows--",

If downloading from the releases, unzip the ColdSnap.zip file to your Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods folder. <br>[h2]Future Work[/h2]<br>Eventually we would like to make the mod more in line with our original plan for the world we’ve created. Things like replacing the boss that is a custom lizard with a more unique enemy, something more inline with the overarching plot of the game. Part of this would be making the mod more self-contained, and eventually would require fewer dependencies. <br>We would also like to make more visual changes, like more custom animations for steam, melting ice, or a dying fireball. Adding more creatures is a more long term goal, along with having puzzle completion having a greater effect on the world, visibly freezing or melting areas as you progress.<br>[h3]Known Bugs and Issues[/h3]<br>[list]<br>   [*] When loading in rooms there are various Futile image loading errors in the development console<br>   [*] When loading in a fireball there is a Futile atlas warning in logs<br>   [*] A second skinnier orb station may bless your world in puzzle room 3.

He does as he pleases<br>[/list]<br>[h2]Disclaimer[/h2]<br>This mod was created as a team project for a game modding class within The School of Interactive Games and Media (IGM)at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester NY. IGM provides an educational environment that supports and encourages creative and collaborative academic inquiry by both faculty and students. IGM’s programs,  coursework, research, and development efforts provide students with the knowledge and skills to pursue meaningful  and rewarding careers in media-centric, interactive software development, while simultaneously advancing the field and helping to provide a well-rounded educational experience.<br>This mod was made by a team of 5 for a game development modding class. Given the group's timeframe, the mod has not been thoroughly playtested and is currently released as an alpha build. Please report any issues or bugs found to the team, along with any information you can provide about any other mods you’re using, and any actions you took so we are able to replicate it.<br>",

In order to configure which guns spawn, a file called 'ArtiArsenalEnabledGuns.txt' will be automatically created in 'Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets' with each gun in the game existing on a line (Besides the secret ones ;) ). Remove guns from that list and they will not spawn in the Firefight gamemode.<br>- In firefight spears will automatically be replaced with rocks by default. You may tick a remix option to disable this.<br><br>NOTE: I would really recommend adding Dino.ArtiArsenal to your list of meadow high impact mods.

"desc": "A mod that brings back lizard eggs to the game, which could only be found in old alpha versions.<br><br>You can try to steal the egg from the lizard's den, but beware of its parent, it will not leave the loss so easily...<br><br>Eggs have a certain chance of appearing, depending on which slugcat you are playing as. It is quite simple to understand that there is an egg in the den: the indicator of the color of the lizard to which the den belongs will light up. To steal an egg from the den, you need to go to the entrance to it and press the 'Grab' button. Restores an egg one or two food pips, depending on size, carnivorous slugcats are saturated twice as much. Also, instead of eating the egg, you can save it, and after a few cycles it will hatch into a young lizard who will immediately become your friend (although in rare cases your friend will be a little more aggressive). The reputation will decrease when the parent lizard sees its egg in the player's hands.<br>MoreSlugCats and The Watcher not required, but provided. Has a Remix settings. Compatible with other lizard mods.

Indigo and Blizzard lizards are especially effected![/b][/h2]<br>[h3]There is nothing I can do to fix this, you will just have to wait for the dependency to update and become more stable.[/h3]<br><br><br><br>[h1]Cream Lizard  ᴾᵘᶠᶠ ᴸᶦᶻᵃʳᵈ[/h1]<br>Despite their colors and spitting ability, they are actually a close cousin to the Green Lizard! These medium sized lizards are just barely light enough to climb poles, which helps them to better reach their favorite diet of invertebrates; but don't be fooled! They will gladly eat an oblivious Slugcat as well.<br>Their bodies produce a fragile projectile that bursts to suffocate their desired prey, allowing them to snipe faster invertebrates before they can flee.<br>Due to this adaptation, it seems that many Centipede species are deathly afraid of them- causing the lizard to act as a natural repellent.<br><br>[h1]Glowzard  ˢᵏᶦⁿᵏ[/h1]<br>They often spend their time camouflaged on ceilings as they let their bright colorful tails dangle down below. The bright glow attracts various critters ranging from Batflies to Leeches, which they then snatch up and eat. It seems there are no limitations to what color a Glowzard may be born with, giving them a wide range of possibilities.<br>However, these glowing tails can also attract unwanted attention from more cannibalistic lizard species; as a result they have adapted to be quite slippery and fast to make up for their naturally frail bodies.<br>Due to their low place in the food chain and their easy to access diet, they make easy tames and companions.<br><br>[h1]Lavender Lizard  ˢᵖᶦᵈᵉʳ ᴸᶦᶻᵃʳᵈ[/h1]<br>Believed to be distantly related to the Caramel Lizard due to their six legs, these lizards are most often found in dark areas infested with Coalescipedes; which they adore to eat. They are notably the only lizard that is naturally venomous, having a similar albeit weaker venom to the Spitter Spider.<br>They are agile and swarming hunters, using their six legs to leap up small distances if they cannot climb, and at times will even form loose packs with other Lavender Lizards much like the Yellow Lizard, though the pack structure is much looser.<br><br>[h1]Mimic Lizard  ᴷᵉˡᵖ ᴸᶦᶻᵃʳᵈ[/h1]<br>These cousins to the Eel Lizard have repurposed their tail fins into a frilly plumage to mimic the carnivorous Pole Plant and Monster Kelp. They appear to share a symbiotic relationship with these plants, often found lurking in environments they would be found in.<br>Due to their poor vision, they are incredibly aggressive and will attack and eat nearly anything they can get ahold of, making them difficult and moody tames.<br><br>[h1]Sea Serpent  ᴺᵃᵍᵃ[/h1]<br>The Sea Serpent is an absolutely massive species of legless lizard that is most often spotted within the depths of Shoreline, though most commonly swarming the Submerged Superstructure. These massive predators are near the top of the food chain, only triumphed by the mighty Leviathan or the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3375001711]Red Aquapede[/url].⁽ᶜᵒᵐᶦⁿᵍ ˢᵒᵒⁿ⁾<br>Their bite is a vice grip, grabbing large creatures such as Vultures into the water to drown and eat, which they often get ahold of after spitting a blast of saliva and water at.<br>It has an incredibly voracious appetite, and as a result makes for one of the most difficult lizard tames.<br><br><br><br>[b]What happened to the full Cloudburst mod?[/b]<br>[i]Due to a combination of other personal projects taking priority, motivation with the Slugbase mod, and lack of modding experience; I have decided to separate Cloudburst into some [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3260747680]character cosmetics[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3260750629]lizards[/url] as their own individual mods.<br>I hope you understand.

"desc": "NOTE: Apparently Drain Mites cause some issues for the Gutter subregion and this has been a long running issue. Just want to be clear that they're not a required dependency and you don't need them enabled to play Archaic Facility.<br><br>An unassuming floodplain separates an island from a ruined superstructure. On an islet between them, three large holes bore from atop the sand, gaping maws that have consumed countless cycles of dust and rain, flooding into the storied caverns and tunnels of an archaic facility. Mosses grow where spiders creep; not all that glows can be trusted. Will you emerge from the darkness alive?<br><br>As it stands, Archaic Facility features:<br>79 rooms with 208 screens<br>2 subregions<br>2 colored pearls with 8 total dialogue variants<br>3 alternative creature token locations for Bry's Drain Mites and Bubble Weavers<br>A safari token (untested)<br><br>This region was made in mind to provide easy access to Bitter Aerie and to provide more alternative entrances to the Sunlit Trail. To be specific, it connects to Submerged Superstructure, Bitter Aerie, and Moss Fields. As a bonus, I wanted to expand the domains of a lot of fitting modded creatures that live in nearby regions. As a consequence of filling up the region with all that fauna and water, it's quite dangerous.<br><br>Karma gate rooms:<br>Bitter Aerie: [spoiler]MS_bitteraccess[/spoiler]<br>Submerged Superstructure: [spoiler]MS_I11[/spoiler]<br>Moss Fields: [spoiler]MF_C02[/spoiler]<br><br>This first version of Archaic Facility is how it stands between Hunter to Monk's times, and will be polished and improved with player feedback before I dive into different worldstates for the other slugcats (I also need to work on the transition rooms in the other regions) - but different campaigns still have different spawns(except Saint). Check the [url=https://rainworldmods.miraheze.org/wiki/Archaic_Facility]wiki[/url] for more info.<br><br>The region's music was composed by a mysterious benefactor, from whom it is also their first contribution to the Rainworld modding scene! They composed two amazing tracks, one of which has two distinct variations to give each subregion its own distinct feel!<br><br>And the lovely region art and thumbnail were made by yours truly. Obviously if anyone wants to make actual region art I'd be happy to replace it, but I think it's funny and works as is, and it's not like no effort went into it, I'm just not a practiced landscape painter :p<br><br>And for the custom creatures and region connection, credit is due to the following folks for creating the content that inspired me to create Archaic Facility:<br><br>-Myrmice: creating Moss Fields, which had two exclusive creatures now found here as well. Myr's aesthetic was a massive inspiration for the region: In Mossy Grotto, I just thought what if we took Moss Fields' beautiful aesthetic, and made it a dark, underwater, frightening and claustrophobic experience full of spiders instead?<br><br>-Bry: for making three fantastic occupants of the region. The Weavers truly define the region in the later campaigns, and no creature can navigate the Archaic Facility as gracefully and freely as they can. Terrifying stuff, really. And the Drain Mites are adorable.<br><br>cyrille.bernard75: The Polliwogs are a cute yet scary inclusion to the region, and very fitting for a lot of the spaces they occupy. The Noodle Eaters are fantastic for breaking up the tension, those absolute goobers. Water Spitters are hilarious and very fitting lizards. Surface Swimmers make for an awesome aquatic bug fitting the Eggbug niche while suiting the region well. Amazing work here that's already been proven by the regions they already occupy.<br>",

This mod takes heavy inspiration from Pups+.<br><br>The setup needed to get this mod to work is minimal. Simply register a puptype with your mod name, a puptype name, and thats it. You've just created your very own puptype. From here, you can treat your pup as though it was just another slugcat with its own name. Registering a puptype can be a optional feature if pupbase is installed (an example being the stalker).<br><br>It's great if you want to avoid any issues with incompatibility. Often times what'll happen is you'll have two conflicting variants of pups, both somehow merged into one as its own cursed hybrid, with conflicting stats. This mod forgoes that and allows modders to not worry about that.<br><br>It also has the necessary code to make pups into adults without much friction, which can have gameplay implications, such as aging.<br><br>If you wish to make mods using this, you have my permission.

But there were no mods on the workshop so I decided I'd try to make it myself. It's not the best thing, but it's my first mod so hopefully y'all won't judge me too hard lol. I spent a good week making this mod, as I started with zero experience. I have so many people to thank, but I'll leave that for the credits section down below. So, I'm sure you're wondering 'What does this mod do exactly?'. Well, it adds a layer of ice to all bodies of water exposed to OPEN SKY. If there's a roof, there will be no ice. I'll list all of the specifics out for you.<br><br>Layers of ice added to:<br>-Frigid Coast/Shoreline (13 rooms! As well as 1 room made easier...)<br>-Glacial Wasteland/Garbage Wastes (7 rooms)<br>-Desolate Fields/Farm Arrays (3 rooms)<br>-Silent Construct (2 rooms)<br>-Icy Monument/Industrial Complex (1 room)<br>-Submerged Superstructure (1 room)<br>(Willing to do more if requested)<br><br>So there you go, that's all there is to it. The 'main attraction' in this mod is Shoreline, and the mod was originally going to just be Shoreline. But I thought, why not give some love to the other places too, right? But if for any reason you don't like a region having the ice, you can remove it! Configuration in modern gaming is just so sweet isn't it?<br><br>Here are the instructions for the Remix Menu. Please follow them CAREFULLY:<br>1) Enable mod and restart.<br>2) Open the remix menu and enable/disable the desired regions then press apply.<br>3) Open the remix menu back up and press and hold the confirm button until fully white (there is no sound).<br>4) Press exit and restart your game.<br><br>Alright, that should be it. I feel like I had a lot more to say when I was making this mod but now I can't think of anything else so I'll just shut up and let you get on with your business lol. Enjoy yourself some Frozen Waters!<br><br>Credit to several people from the Official Rain World Discord Server, as well as the Rain World Modding Discord Server for helping me along the way as I learned what I was doing.<br><br>Remix Menu: Coded by Mills888. Thanks to them for making me a functional Remix Menu, as I have no coding knowledge.<br><br>Ice Prop: Thanks to Solar and his repo for allowing me to use the Coral Caves ice prop (Also thanks to Fishnoid for making Coral Caves and said prop).",

"desc": "ATTENTION!: THIS DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK!!! This mod is currently being UNDER CONSTRUCTION. The Development is in progress is subject to change!<br>Me and Bensone have finally decided to migrate this mod to become it's own campaign and will include regions and creatures & our very own slug, dubbed as 'Outpatient', by programming code. Because of this, this mod will require Downpour (and Maybe The Watcher) to function properly! This mod's current state is meant to act as a place-holder and should not be treated as complete!<br><br>Planned Lore: After thousands of years since the fall of the ancient civilization, a strange viral outbreak has plagued Rain World. Not much is known of the origin of this viral disease which causes a biological alternations of infected creatures, causing increased aggression, restlessness, seizures, bigger and stronger appearence and pretty much untamable. The infected region affects the visual appearance, and the whole enviroment is plagued by a mysterious red taint. Infected are bigger and more dangerous.<br><br>Planned features: On-screen camera will have a red tint similar to when hunter becomes sick, but will be much more intense and permanent. Hallucinations. Custom Items. If outpatient becomes bitten by a infected creature, the player will begin to hallucinate and have violent seizures similar to hunter, failure to get treatment results in death. Custom regions. Outpatient by default will have positive reputatation with Scavengers, who will by default be friendly and attempt to follow you around and defend you from threats. Treatment will only be possible by trading with scavengers, so being nice to scavengers is imperative. Successful trading will have a 'Medicine' Scavenger treat and cure the disease.<br><br>Our very own slug, The Outpatient.<br><br><br>Infected Variants are hostile to all creatures and especially other infected<br><br>The following Creatures included are/will be:<br><br>Rack Lizard (Red x Black) <br>Rain Lizard (Red x Train) <br>Reen Lizard (Red x Green) <br>Rue Lizard (Red x Blue) <br>Rhite Lizard (Red x White) <br>Rellow Lizard (Red x Yellow) <br>Ryan Lizard (Red x Cyan) (Credit to Shiny Kelp) <br>Relamander (Red x Salamander) <br>Reramel Lizard (Red x Caramel) <br>Rink Lizard (Red x Pink) <br>Reel Lizard (Red x Eel) <br>Roop Lizard (Red x Strawberry)<br>Rantern Mice (Infected Mouse)<br>Rulture (Infected Vulture)<br>Rong Legs (Infected Rot)<br>Riros (Infected Miros)<br>Reek (Infected Yeek)<br>Roodle (Infected Noodlefly)<br>Ravager (Infected Scavenger)<br>Rail (Infected Snail)<br>Red Spider (Infected Spider)<br>Ratfly (Infected Batfly)<br>Relp (Infected kelp)<br>Role (Infected Pole)<br>Rentipede (Infected Red Centipede)<br>Redcada (Infected Squid)<br>Reviathan (Infected Leviathan)<br>Rup (Infected Slug pup)<br><br><br>PS. Because of the mod's current development, this means it can or will lose it's support of Lizard customizer as we are discussing whether or not should the lizards be made by code, or keep it how it is. We are also currently developing a discord for this and hope to see you soon and support the development of this up-coming mod!<br><br><br>Credits: Slug made by Alga https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198856632963",

The Executioner and The Hermit have mechanics, but no implemented story yet. Their stories will be added in later updates.<br><br>[b]The Sacrifice[/b] is a small and frail semi-biological creature, which resembles an overseer or a neuron. Its playstyle is focused on making use of your mobility (boostjump using jump + grab!) and your ability to chirp(hold grab), which stuns small creatures and attracts attention. You can also starve to switch modes, or hold up + throw at max food pips to starve manually mid cycle.<br><br>[b]The Executioner[/b] is a large and powerful beast, intent on devouring everything in its path. It can create an electric bomb using 1 food pip by swallowing a rock. You can then hold up + grab to turn the bomb into charges for your abilities, your main one being a dash which you can perform by pressing jump + grab.<br><br>[b]The Hermit[/b] is a small slugcat that uses a snail shell as both its weapon and its shield. You can prepare a snail pop by pressing jump + grab. (Snailcat rework!)<br><br>[h2]More Information:[/h2]<br><br>[b]Recommended mods/settings to use alongside this one (for co-op):[/b]<br>[list]<br>[*]“Individual food bars” by Sprobgik, to allow the Sacrifice’s starvation mechanic separately of other players.<br>[*]Turning off the ‘all players must be in shelter’ requirement in jolly co-op.

(although bugs will most likely be present outside of vanilla regions)<br>Also contains support for a handful of mods! (REGION MODS HAVE THE SAME SPAWNS AT NIGHT!) (Should be Compatible with Rain Meadow!)<br><br>REGION CHANGE DETAILS:<br><br>Outskirts: [Spoiler]Outskirts has stayed relatively same with the lack of rain. However at night, alot of creatures found in hunter campaigns appear to hunt.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Industrial Complex: [Spoiler]due to its proximity to shaded, Industrial Complex has found a lot of creatures migrating into the factory halls for the night. With lantern mice, spiders of all sorts and scavengers being notable visitors.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Drainage System: [Spoiler]Drainage system acts as a refuge for all water dwelling creatures that cannot survive in the open ocean. Tardigrades, Barnacles, salamanders and Eels acting as core denizens of the damp tunnels found here. Due to the vast amount of prey available here, some lizards tend to journey here as their hunting grounds.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Chimney Canopy: [Spoiler]Chimney Canopy, that of which is the canopy of the factory halls, has acted as a major cross road for migrating creatures. Lizards venturing towards Sky islands use this as a core path, while water dwellers such as Eels and salamanders may be journeying towards the depths of the gutter in an attempt to reach their hunting grounds. Due to the amount of traffic in this area at night, vultures of all kinds have taken to this region as their own hunting grounds.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Garbage Wastes: [Spoiler]Garbage Wastes at night is a rarity, in which its traffic drops exponentially at night time, with only apex predators being sighted patrolling here during that time. Some scavengers do stay within the trash heaps to look after the check points, with some brave individuals venturing out for pearls. This also applies to past garbage wastes[/Spoiler]<br><br>Shaded Citadel: [Spoiler]Shaded Citadel is a region that is almost unchanged at night. The already pitch black halls only get worse, with some rooms being almost un-traversable without ample lighting. Due to the lack of change here, the ecosystem of the Citadel is practically the same at night, with the main danger being the visibility.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Pipeyard: [Spoiler]Pipeyard acts as a secondary traversal point to go too and from SL and SI. Vultures use this as a hunting ground if they are out competed in CC but for the most part centipedes roam the mines.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Shoreline: [Spoiler]Night Shoreline is another region that is rather empty at night, with only the purely aquatic creatures staying due to the lack of exit points from the remains of this aquifer. Some predators will however take this chance to prey on the smaller creatures here. This also applies to Waterfront facility however due to the extra terrain and places to hide, the amount of predators is significantly higher[/Spoiler]<br><br>Sky Islands: [Spoiler]Sky Islands (due to its altitude and positioning close to farm arrays) has gained a lot of the same traits as LF. Its sun-soaked, humid and acts as a home for sky dwelling creatures during the day. However during the night as the ambient temperature drops, Lizards make the pilgrimage here to use the metallic surfaces as makeshift 'Warming Rocks', making SI an abundant source of lizards of all kinds.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Farm Arrays: [Spoiler]Due to the lack of rain, LF has become much hotter. the ambient temperature and lack of crushing rainfall has caused farm arrays to become lush and overgrown, due to the thick foliage this region attracts all sorts of insects and other prey animals. As a result at night predators will use the cover of darkness to hunt the more than ample food available.[/Spoiler]<br><br>The Exterior: [Spoiler]The Exterior is similar to shaded in its unchanged nature. With traversal of it being the main danger. Rot cysts may drop down from the interior to consume but outside of that, the ecosystem is roughly the same.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Five Pebbles: [Spoiler]This area is unaffected with the rain, and is entirely enclosed and thus unchanged.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Subterranean: [Spoiler]The depths of these caves is another traversal point, but as a whole acts as a refuge for blind or naturally night dwelling creatures. With it consisting primarily of black lizards, centipedes and monster kelp. Filtration System at night has become a dwelling for orange lizards, that of which out compete day times black lizards and feed on the smaller creatures that wonder into the pipes below.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Outer Expanse: [Spoiler]Outer Expanse is a region that is roughly unchanged from its rainy counterpart. This is due to the majority of the region already being free from the rain. Sunken pier has taken on a lot of the ecosystem that's present in the rest of the region.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Submerged Superstructure: [Spoiler]This regions main changes are found in Bitter Aerie, with the ecosystem being roughly the same due to the hard to reach nature of the sub region. The rest of this region however is enclosed and not exposed to sunlight, as a result the creatures that dwell here have stayed roughly the same.[/Spoiler]<br><br>NMRW needs to be at the TOP of the load order! I cannot guarantee compatibility for mods outside of the list below. LOAD ORDER CHANGES WILL TAKE LONGER TO GO THROUGH WITH NMRW!

Players will be able to draw cards at the end of each cycle, which will have an interesting influence on the game's gameplay and mechanics. During play, players will be able to complete missions to gain experience and increase their level in order to unlock special cards and cosmetics. [b]Compatible with Watcher DLC[/b]<br><br>[h3]/Card System/[/h3]<br>The core mechanic of RandomBuff is 'cards'. Each card can be thought of as a separate mod or game modifier, and once a card is drawn into a player's buff slot, it will be enabled and have an interesting effect on the gameplay. <br>[img]https://rwmoddingch.github.io/ChModdingWiki/assets/WorkShop/Mutation.gif[/img]<br>Usually the player will do two draws at the end of each cycle. In each draw, three cards will be drawn and presented to the player and the player will be allowed to choose one (or two, if this card is in a stack with another card). The first from the 'Positive' and 'Duality' categories, and the second from the 'Duality' and 'Negative' categories. Players can also acquire cards through free draws or cards that come with the Mission Mode. In Free Mode, if a player has a passage, they can remove a card from the buff slot and make it inactive.<br><br>[h3]/Missions，Levels and Cosmetics/[/h3]<br>Players can choose either Free Mode or Mission Mode at the beginning of the game. In Free Mode, players can select 1-5 tasks to start the game or 0 tasks to start Endless Mode. In Mission Mode, players can start the game with some specified cards and missions. <br><br>In both Free Mode and Mission Mode, returning to the Shelter after completing all missions will trigger a checkout, which will give you experience and increase your level based on the game's stats, as well as unlock free card draws, special cards, and cosmetics. cosmetics can add interesting visual effects to your slugcat, but do not provide any special advantages or enhancements.<br>[img]https://rwmoddingch.github.io/ChModdingWiki/assets/WorkShop/Cosm.gif[/img]<br>[b]Special reminder:[/b]<br>-This mod works fine in coop mode.<br>-This mod is compatible with most other community mods, but we still recommend avoiding enabling too many non-essential mods at the same time to minimize lag or crashes.

"desc": "Randomizes the connections between regions, redirecting karma gates to load different regions. Now features better region placement logic and far greater stability!<br><br>UPDATE 1.2.5: Added compatibility with Rain Meadow!!<br>* However, after passing through a gate, DO NOT RE-ENTER THE GATE ROOM (unless absolutely all players have exited). Passing through a gate, exiting it, and then re-entering it (on the same cycle) will crash your game.<br>* Also improved region placement logic significantly.<br>UPDATE 1.2 (Huge update!):<br>* Regions are now arranged by default in such a way that navigating the world has some sense. Try to make a map as you go along of where each region is!<br>* Karma gates no longer forcibly teleport all creatures outside of the gate upon passing through them. Instead, gates should be passable in a fairly normal fashion.<br>    -NOTE: Some gates have hidden connections. Use dev tools (O + M) or the map if you cannot find the exit.<br>* Significant stability and performance improvements. While you might not directly notice all of them, the overall effect should be quite noticeable.<br>* Added the option to keep karma gate requirements unchanged.<br>* Added support for custom regions with 3-letter acronyms.<br><br>I made this mod because I have a problematic playstyle: I rush straight to the nearest functioning iterator and then bee-line towards the Depths. I wanted to explore community-made regions, but most of them are out of the way of normal campaigns. Therefore, I wrote a mod to scramble regions around so I would have to wander around dozens of regions searching for an iterator.<br>This mod makes you go on a hunt for echoes in order to gain 10 (X) karma (or as much karma as is possible) in order to go to an iterator and receive the Mark of communication, which is required to access Subterranean. You may even find yourself exploring Metropolis as Rivulet, or passing through the Exterior and the Rot as Saint!<br><br>Settings explanation:<br>* Gate Karma Penalty: Subtracts from the player's karma when passing through gates, as an extra challenge. I added this because it was too easy to sprint from one region to the next, spending little time in each region.<br>* Karma Per Echo: Recommended to be kept at -1, so that it is automatically generated.<br>* Random Karma Leniency: Makes some karma requirements randomly more lenient.<br>* Regions tab: This enables settings for each region, specifically the ability to make the randomizer ignore a region or to make it forbid entry into that region entirely.<br>The other settings should not be touched, since most are either dysfunctional or potentially game-breaking.<br><br>KNOWN ISSUES:<br>* Upon first starting a campaign/expedition, the gate karma requirements will likely not yet be updated. Use a shelter at least once before passing through any gate.<br>* Having the map open while passing through the gate can create bugs. Just don't open it while using a gate.<br>* The game occasionally freezes upon using the first karma gate. Reload the game and try again.<br>* Custom slugcat campaigns are mostly untested; use at your own risk.<br>* Monk can unlock gates that were never supposed to be unlocked. This is unfortunately unavoidable. Just don't use Monk, coward.<br>* Some custom regions may not work well with the randomizer. If you experience issues with any gates, try using devtools to see the name of the gate before and after you activate it. This will help me troubleshoot.<br>* Several gates have their karma symbols flipped, causing some regions to be erroneously (in)accessable. There is little I can do about the incompetence of other mod authors.",

"desc": "[h1] A (totally not subjective) revamp of the Rain World lizards! [/h1]<br><br>This modpack for the lizard customizator revamps the base lizards of the game, Taking inspiration from speculative evotion! With this mod, you will see:<br><br>[h2] Green Lizards: the robust executioner. [/h2]<br><br>Pushed to the brink by the relentless aggression of the ecosystem, the green lizards have evolved to kept pushing their grow. The biggest and strongest survived, getting better not only at taking damage, but also dealing it.<br><br>Being now the largest and heaviest lizard in these lands, they maximized their bulk and armor, getting to the point of withstanding immense damage without much issue. Having jaws that can shatter bone, one well-placed bite can suprass even the mighty red lizard's one. This new power doesn't come without any cost, as this giants have to eat a lot to sustain their new bodies, even eating other lizards now. This drove them not only to learn to slowly climb walls in order to travel to lands with more food, but also to dive in deep waters to travel catch prey.<br><br>Miros birds, vultures, plants and even the rot tend to avoid this behemoth, aware of the trouble that takes to kill and eat just one. Most of their fights are now intraspecific, shaking the ground as they push and bite each other.<br><br>Weight: 15.<br>Bite damage: 8.<br>Damage chance: 100%<br>Toughness: Both 25.<br><br>[h2] Maned Green Lizards: Invasive new age. [/h2]<br><br>In a world where survival often demands adaptability, the Maned Green Lizard emerged as a distinct subspecies from a population of Green Lizards that did not achieve the same colossal size. As the bigger population bulked up, these lizards developed a more agile build, allowing them to carve out a niche with their bare claws.<br><br>This worked out very well, as the consistent success of this population made it grow in great numbers. The uncontrolled growth sparkled the competition heavily, as new adaptations started to surge; Great manes started to emerge around their necks, alongside new unique patterns, in order to display good health and genes. Armored faces, with spiky horn-like armor evolved alongisde new, never seen of level of agression.<br><br>But with this mix of speed and agression, maned lizards slowly started to expand to new lands. New prey resulted in less competition, and less competition leads to... collaboration. This kind of lizards prefer to focus entirely on their prey, not attacking eachother. To this day, intraspecific fights are weird in maned lizards, and their presence is starting to become more notable. While not as big as greens, maned lizards still manage to dwarf even caramels and to kill most things to saciate their quick metabolisms.<br><br>Only time will tell if the native fauna can cope with it. After all, after every massive extinction a new age begins.<br><br>Weight: 8.6<br>Bite damage: 6<br>Damage chance: 100%<br>Toughness: 20<br>Stun toughness: Similar to red lizards.<br><br>[h2] Blue Lizards: lesser, but better. [/h2]<br><br>Sharing a common ancestry with Cyan Lizards, the Blue Lizards have evolved along a parallel path, developing the same jumping abilities and a familiar pattern that nearly earns them the title of 'lesser cyans.'<br><br>However, the Blue Lizards possess unique advantages that set them apart. Their widespread presence across various regions has given them a solid foothold in the ecosystem, getting most of the time to places where cyans didn't.<br><br>However, what truly makes them formidable, is their newfound social behavior; they no longer attack each other. Instead, Blue Lizards collaborate, working together to corner their prey. Combined with their long jumps, this pack mentality transforms them into a highly efficient and dangerous force, capable of taking down even the most elusive targets.<br><br>[h2] Pink and Black Lizards: Rivalry. [/h2]<br><br>As the shadow citadel became more and more fierce, lots of black lizards starting to move to the surface in order to survive. A world that only became harsher was waiting above, and they would have to adapt or go extinct. <br><br>It wasn't easy, as time blessed generalist animals such as wolf spiders and... Pink lizards, whose have learned to even climb walls independently of their linage. They adapted to move wherever the conditions are suitable, becoming way more resilient that a lot of their pink ancestor to the enviroments.<br><br>Black lizards, luckily, didn't sucumb to the pressure of the ecosystem. As generations passed, their hide got thicker and more loose, allowing them to turn quickly in order to bite anything that comes close. Their bite force grew alongside them, in the same way that their pattern recognition in order to survive. <br><br>It is only the beginning of yet another evolutionary race to remain. <br><br>[h2] Caramel Lizards: Subtle changes. [/h2]<br><br>As caramel lizards lost their once curious 'third pair of legs'—appendages with no clear function—, they did not change a whole lot. Without those appendages bothering it's way of moving, they can now climb poles, making them the only member of the green lizard family that is able to do so.<br><br>[h2] Eels and Yellow Lizards: Convergence. [/h2]<br><br>As times got tougher, some lizards solutioned similar problems with similar solutions. Eel lizards, getting suprisingly outcompeted by salamaders, started to hunt in packs to get more chances of surviving and catching prey. As time went on, eel lizars developed a pair of antenna, in a very similar manner to yellow lizards.<br><br>And speaking of which, yellow lizards didn't lag behind, as they got faster run rates and the capacity of using their tongue to hunt, slowing down prey while other yellows sprint to maul their new prey. The competition with cyan lizards was harsh enough already, so now having their smaller relatives competing for their niche too pushed yellows into the same agression spiral as other species. There may be some more agressive specimens lurking around, slowly waiting to take over the top of the foodchain.<br><br>In any case, the reds, whites and strawberry lizards still didn't change even with the great pass of time, as they're adapted enough to survive in this world. But no world refuses to change, and most probably, these lizards won't refuse to change in the future. Who knows what the future will hold for this scaled creatures? Discover it in a future update of Evolved Lizards!<br>____<br><br>If you want the green maned lizard to appear only, without replacing any lizards, get this mod!<br> [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3320566961] Standalone green maned lizard [/url]<br>The scugs in the photos are from the Cutscene Slugcats mod, made by Auro",

Explore the world and its new mysteries as Wanderer - and prepare your eyes for what the future holds.<br><br>Rain World: Drought v1.1 adds:<br>• A new campaign - Wanderer! Armed with a special tail of benefactor origin, he can zoom his way around the world and deliver the data in record time. But why would iterators need an envoy of biological genesis? And, with how long he's been toiling for, just how much does Wanderer know about this world?<br>• 4 new regions to explore! Carefully picked and chosen to fit into this ruined deluged world are new places for you to explore! Dive deep, scale high and trudge your way through the thicket as you strive to reach your goal, whatever it might be.<br>• New creatures! Some will catch you by surprise, or by your tail. Keep an eye out for dark shadows!<br>• New lore! Drought is based on vanilla 1.5 lore, and as such is different from Downpour's AU. What's different, and what's new? What implications does the new lore bring for the future of this world?<br>• A brand new Weatherblight system! Each cycle brings its own distress. The cycles can be short, barely giving you any time to gather food or progress, or they can be long, but with extremely tough and dangerous bursts of deadly rain in-betwixt! Thankfully it won't get any worse in the future... right?<br><br>The world might be on the brink of peril and yet - it's still a long way off. As Wanderer, take your time, discover the new, dodge the frequent rains and be the envoy of inevitable things yet to come.<br><br>For discussions and bug reports join our Discord Server here: https://discord.gg/awWPsbHvVu<br><br>Currently incompatible with:<br>• Vibe World<br>• Solace",

In addition, it [u]points you toward the best scavenger target within the room[/u], as well as [u]providing a power level for all scavengers[/u], with a configurable keybind to toggle it on/off.<br><br>This mod is specifically designed for Artificer & friends who strive to exterminate the whole scavenger population in a region, without getting killed unfairly. <br><br>For those new to Scavenger extermination and combat, the mod’s utility may not be obvious at first. I encourage you to read along, but beware of heavy spoilers regarding Scavenger AI design, combat logic and many technical knowledge of the game!<br><br><br>[h3]Detailed description:[/h3]<br>This mod does 7 things:<br>[olist]<br>[*]Displays the number of scavenger kills you have obtained in this cycle.<br>[*]Displays the number of maximum attainable scavenger kills at the current moment.<br>[*]Displays the total number of scavengers that spawned in this cycle.<br>[*]Displays the countdown until a scavenger kill / protect squad can potentially spawn near<br>you. (though you will probably only encounter kill squads lol)<br>[*]Displays the number of scavengers in the squad if the squad is active.<br>[*]Displays the most desirable target scavenger to destroy in the room, if there is one<br>available, as an arrow next to your Slugcat.<br>[*]Displays a level for every scavenger, such that higher levels ones have better combat skill<br>stats.<br>[/olist]<br><br>I encourage you read the wiki on scavengerAI, as well as the technical pages for<br>scavenger combat skills if these concepts are confusing.<br><br>Items 1 - 5 can be viewed during gameplay and the hibernation screen by pressing the map button. Specifically, you can use the ratio of item 1 and item 2 to determine how safe you are from a surprise scavenger attack, while the ratio of item 1 and item 3 shows you how close you are to clear the region. Items 1 - 3 are arranged as three numbers next to each other like “(1/2/3)” when you press the map. Note that for item 5, not all scavenger spawns in the world are classified as kill squads. There are small inconsistencies in this number, but it should roughly do its job.<br><br>Item 7 can be toggled on / off with a button of your choice. The color of the arrow and the levels interpolates from white to red to indicate how high the level is. The formula for the level is the weighted average between the five combat skills of the scavenger, multiplied by 100, with a heavier weight applied toward the reactionSkill. Use these numbers to choose from a more conservative / aggressive attack plan. <br><br>All items can also be turned off in the Remix menu!<br><br>[h3]FAQ:[/h3]<br>Q: What is the difference between item 2 and item 3?<br>A: Item 2 decreases when a scavenger retreats or dies for a non-player cause, while item 3 does not.<br><br>Q: What mods are compatible with this?<br>A: Known compatibilities: SBCameraScroll, HealthBar, JollyCoop, DevConsole, WarpMenu (mostly).<br><br>Q: How does item 6 calculate the best scavenger to point?<br>A: It points to the nearest scavenger to you, but if a scavenger is also able to hit you, the pointer is more preferential toward it compared to another scavenger on the other side of a wall.<br><br>Q: My game crashed!<br>A: Sorry about that! Contact Nacu in the RW discord to report the bug. Send the exceptionLog as well.<br><br>Q: Why do you hate the scavengers sooo much :(<br>A: Scavs are an incredible feat for RainWorld’s developers. Fighting them feels like fighting real players in an online game, and it feels awesome to play the game at its full potential.<br><br>[h3]Credits:[/h3]<br>[list]<br>[*]Author: Nacu (@smalltowniak on discord)<br>[*]Commissioned & Tested by: 雨世界实验室 (@rwlab4594 on discord)<br>[/list]<br><br>Github link: https://github.com/Nacu0021/ScavIntel",

"author": "LazyCowboy",
"desc": "A mod that balances the Downpour slugcats to be less OP whilst adding some fun new mechanics to keep things fun. ALL of these changes can be totally disabled in the mods's config menu (or modified to your liking). Since its initial release, this mod has grown to encompass many ideas for slugcat nerfs, several of which you may dislike. That's fine! Disable or tweak them to your liking!<br>Ever felt like Gourmand creating life was a little unrealistic? Or Artificer is totally over-powered and not fun? Or Rivulet gets too easy after taking the Cell? Or Saint's tongue shouldn't launch you so high? Well, this mod fixes all of that!<br><br>UPDATE 1.1.0: Rain Meadow compatibility!<br>Not that Meadow compatibility matters too much. Really, all this does is prevent you from using this mod as a 'cheat.'<br>Yeah, sorry, no more cheating.<br><br>Gourmand:<br>* Gourmand moves 10% faster when on an empty stomach (but gets exhausted 10% more quickly) (configurable).<br>* Crafting Nerfs: Gourmand can no longer create life or void-powered explosives.<br>* Gourmand's slide speed is reduced slightly (0.8x) (configurable in the config menu).<br>* Gourmand's spears deal 0.8x damage than usual. You can alter this number to your pleasure in the config menu.<br>* Gourmand becomes exhausted 10% faster when at 0 food pips, lessening as Gourmand consumes more food. (Additionally, Gourmand's overall rate of exhaustion can be configured, but is unchanged by default.)<br>(Gourmand has minimal changes that don't affect his gameplay much, except it'll be harder to kill the red centipede.)<br><br>Artificer:<br>* Movement speed is slightly reduced (0.9x) (configurable).<br>* Scavenger population is 50-60% of what it previously was, making things easier. (Alternatively, you can increase the population).<br>* Crafting explosives now costs twice as much food (but only requires 1 pip).<br>* Artificer's explosion jumps are less powerful (0.8x), restraining mobility slightly. Or you can increase the explosion power...<br>* Explosion jumps and parries reduce your food by a quarter-pip (configurable) (optionally can make this required to explosion jump).<br>* Parries now count as two explosion jumps towards the explosion counter.<br>* Being stunned by explosions causes Artificer to overheat (configurable).<br>* Scavengers are worth half as much food in Artificer's campaign (only 2 pips) (configurable). This encourages the player to find other food sources.<br>* Artificer's spear throws can now be angled up to 25 degrees (configurable)! Now you can stab scavs slightly above or below you!<br>* (Artificer's throwing ability can be optionally configured.)<br>* Artificer's spear throws are significantly slower in arena mode only (configurable).<br>* For quality-of-life, Artificer's second ending can be obtained after the first one on the same save file now (configurable). (Note: Works by resetting all echo progress upon achieving the first ending (so echoes can be revisited). Makes visiting echoes still grant karma.)<br>(Artificer's absurdity was what prompted this mod to be made. I reduced her powers but also her threats (scavs), and gave her the unique ability to fight back against scavs better by angling spear throws.)<br><br>Rivulet:<br>* Rivulet's land movement speed is decreased (0.8x) (configurable).<br>* Rivulet's spear throwing ability and damage is reduced to be identical to Monk's.<br>* Rivulet's slide speed is slightly decreased (0.8x) (configurable).<br>* Rivulet's jump height is significantly decreased (0.8x) (or you can increase it in the config menu).<br>* (Rivulet Spoilers:) Taking 5P's Cell no longer extends cycles (by default, taking the Cell doubles or triples cycle length). Instead, it makes precycles much more common, but precycle rain is less dangerous.<br>* Rot walls will not pull in Rivulet as hard, making escape more likely.<br>(Rivulet just needed minor decreases in movement. However, taking the Cell made gameplay easy in the base campaign. Now you'll have to use its power to rush through the light rain.)<br><br>Spearmaster:<br>* Spearmaster's movement speed has been slightly decreased (0.9x) (configurable).<br>* Takes a quarter-pip of food away for every second spear produced (configurable).<br>* Growing a spear without any food causes Spearmaster to have Gourmand's exhaustion for a few seconds (configurable).<br>* Repeatedly throwing spears (and/or growing them with food) can briefly trigger Gourmand's exhaustion mechanic for a second or two (configurable).<br>* Increased the chance of dying instantly to a lizard bite by 50% (configurable).<br>* Increased Spearmaster's jump height by ~10% (configurable) to make platforming sections slightly easier and to compensate for the 10% speed decrease.<br>* Spearmaster's produced needles now only deal 80% of their former damage (1 damage when thrown by Spearmaster). This makes normal spears still valuable.<br>* (Spearmaster's throwing ability can be optionally configured.)<br>* (The rate at which Spearmaster grows spears can be optionally configured, but is unchanged by default.)<br>(Spearmaster didn't really need any gameplay balancing. The eighth-pip cost is insignificant unless you tend to spam spears, and the exhaustion mechanics are just a fun gimmick to make spamming spear throws slightly harder.)<br><br>Saint:<br>* Saint's tongue produces less upward velocity when being retracted (configurable). This makes Saint's tongue function more like a Grapple Worm.<br>* Saint's tongue is now shorter (80% of previous length).<br>* Saint cannot lean to the side as far while hanging down from the ceiling.<br>* Saint's swinging speed (when grappling using his tongue) is increased by 50%.<br>* Saint's tongue can now be aimed precisely using a controller stick.<br>* Lanterns swallowed by Saint provide much less heat (0.6x) (configurable). Now it's much better to hold them.<br>* The amount of heat provided by external objects is very slightly reduced (0.9x).<br>* (The rate at which Saint's temperature changes can be optionally configured.)<br>* Saint's 'God Timer' is slightly reduced (configurable). Its recharge rate is optionally configurable.<br>(Saint could basically fly by spamming the jump button. Now his tongue simply functions as an OP Grapple Worm instead of a mode of sustainable flight. Additionally, hoarding 2 lanterns made the hypothermia mechanics irrelevant, so lanterns are now less potent.)<br><br>If there is anything else that annoys you about the Downpour slugcats that you want balanced, make a suggestion; maybe I'll make the change for you. If your suggestion is based how over-powered the slugcat is in arena mode, mention that in your suggestion.<br>And if you complain that my settings aren't severe enough... click on the 'Extreme Settings' preset.",

(reuploaded due to crashing)<br><br>Natural spawns added, no need for simple spawn swapper!<br><br>Black Centipede: Blind, like black lizards and are allied with them too. About as big as a red centipede. They can be found in all regions black lizards are found in, and in outer expanse at night<br><br>Blue Centipede: Medium to big sized centipedes, they are the most territorial of any centipede, they will even kill other members of their species. They are widespread but hibernate during rivulet because of the heavy rain. During saint their population explodes.<br><br>Cyan Centipede: A big centipede that is able to fly without wings though it mostly likes to walk instead. it eats some other species of centipedes including other cyan centipedes. Only found in the very early campaigns though can be lineaged.<br><br>Grey Centipede: Aggresive long legged centipede with a lethal shock. They are found in every campaign in almost every region.<br><br>Elder Centiwing: Giant centiwings that are slightly more aggresive to slugcat. Spawns coming later!<br><br>Pink Centipedes: Medium sized fast centipede. They are kinda boring(like pink lizards), although they are very aggresive. They are widespread and can be lineaged into red centis among other centis.<br><br>White Centipedes: Giant neutral centipedes that have a curious nature. Look but dont touch... Found across the map in pairs of 2, Sadly spearmaster ate one of them in waterfront facility and is the reason why arti only finds 1 in her campaign.<br><br>Gigantopede: Long centipede...thankfully doesnt spawn in story mode<br><br>Baby Lizard: Unlike other species of lizards, these lizards live entirely inside of their mother, though once isolated from them will walk around without any fear of predators<br><br>Mother Lizard: Female versions of green lizards, these lizards can climb, unlike green lizards, and are smaller in size. If they are approached by what they think is a predator, they will spit out a Baby lizard, hoping that the predator eats the baby lizard instead. They only spawn at outskirts because its a breeding ground for green lizards.<br><br>Baby iguana: Baby versions of iguana lizards. They dont spawn.<br><br>Iguana lizards,: Intelligent species of lizards that have many enemies, including spards and yellow lizards. They are neutral to slugcat and instead spend their days protecting baby iguanas. They also have 360 vision, like Spards. They are found in Subterrenean and Outer Expanse, can be lineaged into King Lizards. They also migrated to Undergrowth during saints campaign.<br><br>Brickstone Lizard: Extremely rare species of lizard, they have giant yellow eyes unlike the rest of the lizard family. Only found in Sky islands, where they live in colonies<br><br>Cat Lizard: A species of slugcat that has evolved to look like lizards to avoid predators. They are also one of the rarest types, to find one you must kill the infant centipede that spawns in OE_RUIN17, whom will reincarnate as a catlizard next cycle. Eating the centipede will make the cat lizard no longer spawn.<br><br>King Lizard: A beefy and tanky lizard with a crown to show the other peasant lizards who the true king of the (rain) world is. They can take many spears to the face(literally) before giving up. Unlike other lizards, they do not have shielded faces. They are found in farm arrays and outskirts, but can lineaged by killing Iguanas<br><br>Mimic lizard: A big lizard that has evolved to look like blue lizard to trick them into thinking they are an ally. Green lizards may also attempt to eat them...but fail. They are found in many regions, usually alone<br><br>Spard: A cross between a spider and lizard, they share both abilities, with the powerful bite of a lizard and the many legs of a spider, they pose a significant threat to slugcat. Avoid them if possible, as they share many symbiotic relationships with other lizards and spiders that they may use to their advantage. They also hate iguana lizards for some reason. They can be found in many regions though only appear during night. Their main home is shaded citadel<br><br>Tiny lizard: A tiny lizard species with the ability to glow in the dark, slugcat may use this to their advantage in the shaded citadel, as they are swallowable and grabbable. Though catching one may be hard, making them stay in your hand is even harder. They are common prey to other lizards. They spawn in very few dark regions.<br><br>BTW Frogs v2 has been cancelled and instead merged with 100 creatures incase anyone was wondering!",

(More Slugcats Expansion is extremely recommended)<br><br>NOTE: THIS ITEM DOES NOT SPAWN NATURALLY! If you want to be able to obtain swords in your playthrough, use the spawn settings in the config menu for this mod, or spawn it in sandbox, or use the Sword expedition perk.<br><br>(Update 1.0.7: Rain Meadow support + minor hitbox improvements + support for multiple sword retextures)<br><br>If you couldn't guess by now, this is a bit of a joke mod; but that didn't stop me from wanting to make it decent quality. The sword is an absurdly effective weapon against any creature, but it's not unbeatable. Have fun slicing up every creature in sight, though!<br><br>Sword Mechanics:<br>* Press throw to attack using the sword (this technically throws the sword, holds it in front of your slugcat, then returns it to your hand if it is still empty).<br>* Swinging the sword in mid-air will give you a boost in the direction of your swing, allowing for some fun movement.<br>* Swords can deflect thrown weapons and parry other swords, allowing for some PvP combat.<br>* Dual-wielding is not intended, but it's funny. Dual-wielding swords can be disabled in the config menu.<br>* Using the sword factors in your input directions:<br>    - Swinging upward will flip many creatures over.<br>    - Slicing downward will stun creatures for much longer.<br>    - Stabbing forward has the longest reach and transfers your momentum.<br>* Most arbitrary numbers in my code are modifiable in the config menu, so feel free to modify them to your liking.<br><br>PVP + EXTRAS:<br>* Increase the parry window so players will have more time to react in a fight (but don't make it more than half the swing time).<br>* Decrease the damage and stun modifiers, so that one hit with a sword isn't instant-death.<br>* Increasing the pushback amounts will improve the feel of combat, since it's harder to run straight through someone's defense.<br>* Enabling stamina mechanics discourages button mashing by causing swings to become weaker, shorter, and more parry-able if used repeatedly; and consecutive swings can even cause exhaustion (like Gourmand).<br>    -(Note: Slugcats' in-game stamina meter is increased by actions such as running and especially jumping, so it's possible to become exhausted after only 1 swing if the slugcat is already tired.)<br>* Enabling omnidirectional swings and vertical pushback > 1.5 allow for Hollow-Knight-style pogos and vertical attacks.<br><br>Check out kitsu ||'s Nail Mod texture + sound effects!<br>If any modder wants to use this item for anything, it's ID is 'SwordMod_Sword'.<br><br>KNOWN ISSUES:<br>* The sword frequently doesn't appear in shelters when first loading a save. This can be fixed by immediately exiting to menu and re-entering that slugcat's save.",

Yes, and a ton, you will behave almost like a slugpup, with some changes, for example, it's all relative so if you pick rivulet you will be faster than a normal slugpup  [*] Is it only cosmetic? No, you could try to make it, I haven't tested much but there is a toggle in the stats settings to turn off changing stats, that way you will still be small but no stats will be changed  [*] What is configurable? Every stat you have as a player, along with holding double spears as spearmaster or holding 2 items no matter what or not letting people grab you[/list][hr][/hr][h3]Credits[/h3]- amione - Creator- youbitchoc - For helping in development- henpemaz - For Rain Meadow- phanie - For the art- Maxi Mol - For Mouse Drag code- LDani, simichan1227 - For testing the s**t out of my mod (It was kinda encouraging)[hr][/hr][h3]Report Issues on github please! https://github.com/xamionex/Pupifier/issues/new[/h3]    ",

The Nightstriker is an original slugcat designed by my friend, PPMiecoo. We both wanted to bring it to life, and thus, this mod was created.<br><br>I'm just a beginner, stumbling my way through its development, and there are still many areas that need improvement. If you encounter any bugs or issues, feel free to leave a comment. If possible, providing the ExceptionLog file from your local game directory when errors occur would be especially helpful!<br><br>This mod was made possible thanks to the support of many developers in the community. In particular, Quaeledy (creator of The Outsider) and Tricrystal (creator of The Vanguard) helped answer countless questions and provided solutions throughout the process. I also referenced many tutorials from community modders. Additionally, the members of the Dev group and the SlugBase developers offered immense help.<br>Without the assistance of the Rain World community, this mod would never have been possible.<br><br>Thank you so, so much to every developer and friend who helped me along the way!<br>",

Explore the towering mechanical structures or slither below in the tunnels of the forgotten grounds they were built atop. <br><br>This region has drastically different worldstates for slugcats in the MSC mod (or 'Downpour' DLC), and the Official Developer Recommended Order™ is as follows:<br>Survivor entering from [spoiler]Outer Expanse[/spoiler] -> Spearmaster -> Rivulet  entering from [spoiler]Underpass[/spoiler]<br><br>Deluge will be updated incrementally with new region expansions in the future, with no ETA or promises as I do not wish to inflate hype or raise expectations, so until more is revealed for upcoming regions, consider Consecrated Steppe to be the main contents of this mod.<br><br>I also want to give a gigantic thank you to all the friends and seasoned Rain World modders that gave kind words and feedback during the infancy of this mod, it truly meant the world, and I cannot stress enough how helpful it all was in getting through this project and getting it out to people.

I am trying to  optimize this aspect.<br><br>This mod is also effective in multiplayer online mode.<br><br>You can also press the designated key (default is U) to revert your magical spear back to a normal spear.<br><br>When the color option in the configuration is enabled, a magical spear that detects danger will turn yellow, and it will turn red when attacking a creature.<br><br>The key bindings can all be changed in the mod configuration.<br><br>I am learning how to develop a well-rounded mod, and I greatly appreciate all the comments and suggestions, they have been helpful to me.<br><br>Changelog: March 9th<br>Fixed the bug where the magical spear would jitter oddly in water.<br>Magical spears no longer target litter bugs.<br>Spinning magical spears cannot be picked up; however, scavengers will still attempt to retrieve them.<br><br>这个mod允许你将你的矛变成可以自动追踪敌人和发射的魔法矛。<br><br>当你按下设置中的按键时（默认为N），你手中的矛变成魔法矛；它们会攻击范围内离你最近的任一生物，除非该生物对你有高好感。你需朝向魔法矛的发射方向来允许矛的发射，但在你突然改变方向时它们可能会飞向反向，我正在尝试优化这一部分。<br><br>该mod在多人联机中同样起效。<br><br>你也可以按下按键（默认为U）将你的魔法矛变回普通矛。<br><br>当配置中的颜色选项被启用时，检测到危险的魔法矛会变成黄色，攻击生物时会变成红色。<br><br>按键配置均可在模组配置中更改。<br><br>感谢所有的评论和建议，我正在学习如何写作一个完善的mod。<br><br>更新日志：3月9日<br>修改了魔法矛在水中奇怪抖动的bug<br>魔法矛不再瞄准垃圾虫<br>旋转的魔法矛不可以被拾取，尽管如此，拾荒者依然会试图拾取它们",

Customize your board, complete challenges, or compete for goals with other players!! <br><br>[b]I recommend watching the two videos above for a good overview/explanation of what Bingo Mode is about![/b]<br><br><br>[b]You'll get a lot of this through checking the mod out, but I want to give a quick description as well:[/b]<br>Available in the Expedition menu is an alternative gamemode built on top of Expedition. Remember that Bingo and Expedition saves are shared!<br><br>When in the bingo menu, you can hover over any challenge to find out its goal, click on any of them to customize specific values or change the challenge type alltogether, change the board size, and other cool things!<br><br>Multiplayer in Bingo is started by pressing the 'Multiplayer' (wow) toggle in the top left corner. There, you might create or join a lobby! The host may pick everyone's teams, which can decide if you want to cooperate or play competitively!<br>In Multiplayer, only the board states are shared online, you won't see actual other player slugcats!<br>You may choose to play one of three gamemodes when playing multiplayer:<br>[list]<br>    [*]Bingo - Completing any single line of goals counts as a win<br>    [*]Lockout - Completing a goal prevents all of the other teams from completing the same one, you win the same as in Bingo gamemode, or through getting more than half of the squares, while all other teams are locked out of getting a bingo line.<br>    [*]Blackout - Only completing [i]every[/i] goal counts as a win<br>[/list]<br><br>While in game, you may open the bingo board HUD using your specified keybind (remember to rebind it in the Remix settings!) - Space by default. There you can view your progress on all the goals!<br>In there, you may also 'Tally up' - count goal completions for each team and conclude the game for everyone, if you wish to end early!<br><br>If you ever want to view copied bingo boards outside of the game, please check out the [url=https://t3sl4co1l.github.io/bingovista/bingovista.html]Bingo Mod Board Viewer[/url] made by T3sl4co1l!<br><br><br>[b]Happy Bingoing! Hope you enjoy your stay. There's a lot more to discover![/b]<br><br>[h3]Mod compatibility[/h3]<br>This mod is probably incompatible with Rain Meadow. Otherwise, when it comes to region or slugcat mods, they should work in bingo fine! I can't guarantee compatibility though.<br><br>[h3]Open source[/h3]<br>This mod is open source! Check it out on github here: https://github.com/Nacu0021/BingoMode<br>Feel free to make pull requests with new additions, improvements, and other things! If it's proven to work and be stable and cool, I (or someone else) will gladly add your features to this mod!<br>Me personally, I won't be updating this mod unless to fix it due to bugs/breaking changes (watcher dlc), so I give control of new features to anyone interested and commited!

Anyway they should be compatible if you want to install that mod too.)<br><br>Q: What will set off the barnacles?<br>A: Any source of damage aside from bites, or being stunned for a long time by things like snails or jellyfish.<br><br>Q: Why do barnacles make so many rocks when they explode?<br>A: This is a vanilla thing, they do that when they lose their shells.<br><br>Q: Why?<br>A: I didn't want to deal with vanilla barnacles but also wanted them to still do something.

Highly recommended that you restart Watcher's campaign for this, obviously.<br><br>!! -Examples & Highlights To Grab Your Attention- !!<br>- Outer Rim's wind blows toward The Throne instead of away from it<br>- Coral Caves has much less static visuals<br>- Heat Ducts and Thermal Relay use objects from the Shrouded Assembly mod<br>- All of the Aether Ridge regions are much more unique from each other and have improved visuals<br>- Shrouded Coast has its old gimmick from the mod version<br>- Verdant Waterways is overgrown with foliage and has only green creatures in it<br>- Badlands has less locusts and more spore puffs<br>- Over half the regions in the campaign have different end-of-cycle effects<br>- Fetid Glen is much smaller and it's a lot easier to see in it<br>- The rotten base game regions have spawns that fit much better<br><br>Important! The mod adds and changes several rift connections, so the interactive map you can find online is not 100% reliable now. You can use the in-game map but if you'd like to see them before playing, a semi-comprehensive list of them is in the pinned discussion post or in the 'notes-rifts.txt' file if you know how to access the files for this mod.<br><br>Some changes cause the in-game map to display incorrect water levels or not display terrain correctly, and fixing them would require manually remaking the map image files, since the program I use to generate maps and room connections does not account for those changes.<br>Additionally, the new rifts added by the mod sometimes like to 'double' their visual effects, meaning they display as two rifts in the exact same spot, but it shouldn't have any gameplay impact and will be fixed next update.<br><br>HIGHLY recommended that you play this with Watcher QOL, that mod adds some new obscure creature interactions which this one makes more common.<br>Stay tuned for future updates! I've got some big plans for the next ones.",

"desc": "So, Aether Ridge was one of my favorite region mods from back in the day before downpour. When I saw it in the screenshots for the Watcher DLC I was super excited to finally have a port of this legendary region for modern versions of rain world!<br><br>Unfortunately the version of Aether Ridge that we got in the DLC is lacking in many regards (in my opinion)! The entire region, which was notorious for being enormous, has now been sliced up into 5 separate small regions that do not connect to each other in the way they were originally meant to. All of the lore pearls, echos, and gate connections are gone as well. Personally, I think this is a BAD way to experience Aether Ridge. but sadly this is now the first time experience for many players.<br><br><br>[h2] Ok, enough of the tirade, what is this mod? [/h2]<br><br>This is an attempt to restore Aether Ridge to the way it was prior to the Watcher (or at least as close as I can manage). That means re-adding gates to Sky Islands and Subterranean, lore pearls, and most importantly reconnecting all the subregions so that our beloved desalination rig can be whole once more!<br><br>One concession though: since the subregions were moved into their own region prefixes, moving all the rooms back into a single region would require renaming every single room file. Since I do not have the know-how to automate that or the free time to do it manually, I will compromise and add gates where the subregions used to connect. It's not a perfectly faithful fix, but this is the only way I can maintain my sanity while doing this.<br><br>This mod is intended to be used while playing as vanilla slugcats. Having gates for Watcher would allow them to access sky islands and sub, which is not intended and would probably cause progression issues, if not game breaking bugs! So, consider only using this mod while playing as Monk, Survivor, or Hunter!<br><br>I will not be making any new content in this mod. Everything will either be pulled from the Watcher's version of AR or from the old version on RainDB!<br><br>It would be really funny if it turns out the original creator is planning to upload a direct port of AR to the workshop, which would make all this obsolete... But as much as I hope and pray that we get an official port, I feel like AR's inclusion in this condition in a paid DLC is kinda the nail in the coffin for that hope.<br><br><br>Currently implemented:<br>- Echo + unique echo song (Special thanks to Dag_ed for decrypting the echo dialogue!)<br>- Unlockable arenas<br>- Lore pearls<br>- Sky Islands gate + rooms leading up to the gate<br>- Subterranean gate + rooms leading up to the gate<br>- Gates connecting all AR subregions together* as they did prior to Watcher<br>	*Mostly. Since there can't be more than two gates between the same two regions there are two connections between 'Aether Ridge' and 'Heat Ducts' that are no longer with us. I tried to keep the connections that seemed the most impactful.<br>- Restored the old versions of rooms WARE_I01x, WARG_G06, AND WARG_G22<br>- Removed the blue lizard in WARF_A01<br>- Disconnected rooms leading to Fallen Tramway (Saint version of Arial Tramway)<br>- Removed cosmetic rifts from rooms that have portals for Watcher<br><br>Planned:<br>- Re-add gate to Coral Caves<br>- Re-add region art<br>- Make subregion gates usable multiple times per cycle<br>- Maybe re-add gate to Gilded Sanctuary?<br>- Maybe restore old color palette in Cold Storage?<br>- Maybe make unique gates instead of copying the same one?<br><br>Let me know if I missed any connections or if it's broken or anything else important! Have a nice day!<br>",

"desc": "[h2]The Ambulant (Lite)[/h2]This mod (mostly) replaces Hunter with Ambulant, a slugcat of whom is from a different mod I’m currently developing. Mainly meant so that I could actually play Ambulant on Meadow’s Arena mode (since SlugBase screws up Meadow A LOT), but I won’t stop you from using the mod for other purposes. [u]In Arena, Ambulant is a little above Hunter, but definitely lower-tier than the likes of Rivulet or Artificer.[/u]I don’t plan on TOO much upkeep of this mod, but feel free to comment on any bugs you find that you can confirm are specific to this mod. [u]Also, if you don’t want players using this mod, you can just put nassoc.ambulantlite at the bottom of the meadow-bannedmods.txt file of your StreamingAssets folder.[/u]Also, I’m not gonna be releasing movement documentation until the actual full mod comes out, sorry… (Don’t worry, there are no key combinations or overpowered tech!)Some differences between this mod and the main mod:- Main uses SlugBase, this replaces Hunter.- All non-code-mod content is removed here, such as CRS Challenges or easter eggs.- Main is incompatible with Meadow unless everyone has it, this is compatible as a client-side mod.- Main has Dress My Slugcat textures, this doesn’t. (If you really feel like it, use b03b27 for the most accurate coloring.)Some known bugs I probably won’t fix:- The Hunter passage is named The Ambulant passage :troll:- 'Throwless Boosting'  SOMETIMES doesn’t work in any Meadow online mode (even as host) for some reason (most notably before PVP starts), presumably because throwing is handled differently online.- Any entity-related stuff such as rolling off Dart Maggots doesn't work unless you are the host, due to the fact that Dart Maggots' movement and attachment status are handled by the host, not the client.Also, go check out the [url=https://rainworldmods.miraheze.org/wiki/Ambulant_(Lite)]wiki page[/url]!",

This mod will give unique worldstates for certain regions for slugcats such as SPEARMASTER, ARTIFICER, and HUNTER<br><br>Right now it has a past worldstate for Spearmaster's Outskirts 'Urban Expanse', and now you may ask : 'What's a 'Triple Trouble' if there's only Spearmaster?' Well, Artificer's and Hunter's versions of the Outskirts will be coming when I'm fully satisfied with the Base version (Spearmaster's Outskirts)<br><br>Though, this mod is on the big break and Spearmaster's Outskirts are finished, things may change eventually, especially if a better idea is given for certain things. So, fret not to give suggestions, they are always welcome!<br><br>Right now, besides Outskirts, are planned fully new worldstates only for Chimney Canopy, Industrial Complex and secret little tweaks for certain regions that I will not name here.<br><br>Know this, though. This release contains: working and useful map found- ALIVE?!; questionable level design; questionable creature spawns; lack of compatibility with anything; broken Vista Points challenge for Spearmaster's Outskirts (I'm unsure if I'll ever fix this, I tried everything)",

(Right: Moon, Left: Seeker)<br>   - Self Pearl Reading: Seeker has new reading dialogue for most vanilla and MSC pearls, some contain original lore, and some are summaries.

With over 60 rooms of puzzles split between 5 regions, players of all skill levels will find a challenge made for them! From the calming Vibrant Shores to the fiery Icebreaker, can you collect all 30 colored pearls?<br><br>Rules:<br> - Play as Hunter- the portal is right next to your spawn! Increasing your cycle count is recommended.<br> - Make sure the “Vanilla Exploits” remix setting is on. Many solutions will not work if it is off!<br> - For the intended solutions, don’t bring anything between the puzzle regions. Bringing things into or out of the hub is allowed.<br><br>Solutions and hints: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l7I0J0uXzxAmciCAmLxXHbLLsN2cTyNwAfYp8bumFwI/edit?usp=sharing<br><br>FAQ:<br>Q: How hard are the puzzles? <br>A: All the puzzles are focused on knowledge rather than execution, and no precise movement is required for any region. As for the knowledge you’ll need, it depends- each region has puzzles around a certain difficulty. Vibrant Shores is the easiest, and a clever player without any prior knowledge of tech could reach most pearls. The other regions gradually ramp up in difficulty, until you reach the Algae Vats; very few players will be able to collect all the pearls here. <br><br>Q: The portals aren’t working! <br>A: Shelter, then try again. Hunter isn’t able to enter more than one portal per cycle, this is a limitation of the game that I can’t change.<br><br>Q: How many pearls are in each region?<br>A: The blue lights near each portal in the hub show the amount of pearls in each region. You can also use a mod such as “Extended Collectibles Tracker” https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3244633122 to track your progress. Note that none of the pearls have custom dialogue!<br><br>Q: I’m stuck, where do I ask for help? <br>A: The doc above has hints and all the puzzle solutions players have found so far. If you need more help, the #movement channel in the Rain World discord is the best place to ask for help. Also check out the tech iceberg thread in that channel, as well as its respective doc; these are good resources explaining every tech in the game.",

It's hopefully an overall gameplay improvement, focusing on making traversal a lot easier since the anti-gravity hardly ever goes to full 100%, though I never got around to redoing the creature spawns so the mobile cysts that got in the way before are still going to.

HENCE WHY THERES NO STORY!!!<br>hello! as a disclaimer, this mod is NOT DONE YET! i plan to update it and make a complete version! heres a list of things i have yet to add. This is a very basic and stupid mod.<br><br>- Tank being fat like Gourmand.<br>- Tank being able to tank 3 spears before dying.<br>- [spoiler] REALISM [/spoiler]  playing Whatsapp sound effects upon spawning in. <br>- Tank becoming exhausted after climbing poles.<br>- ...Campaigns? Maybe?<br>(i have no idea how id do this besides campaigns, help is appreciated!)<br><br><br>[h1] Characters! [/h1] <br><br>In this mod, there are 3 characters! No more, no less. They are all based around Arena Mode, hence their names.<br><br> [h2] The Knight: [/h2] <br>A kind-spirited warrior originating from [spoiler] Outer Expanse [/spoiler] , having a strong throwing arm and a backspear similar to The Hunter. He can climb faster than most Slugcats as well. <br><br> [h2] The Tank: [/h2] <br>A large and aggressive creature, born in the Shaded Citadel. She feasts on other Slugcats primarily, as most other creatures don't fill her fully (not reflected in game!). She can pull spears from walls and body slam creatures, as well as having the ability to maul others. <br><br> [h2] The Nimble: [/h2] <br>A weaker Slugcat than the other two mentioned. She can dual-wield spears and is quick, but due to her illness, she is about as strong as Monk. <br><br>[h1] Maps! [/h1] <br><br>There are six maps.<br><br>The Unholy Pit<br>Kace Playground (designed by my younger sibling!)<br>Lvl Wall<br>Pvp Turfwar<br>Xena Factory (also designed by another younger sibling!)<br>Pipes<br><br>I hope you have fun! Let me know what else I should add!",
