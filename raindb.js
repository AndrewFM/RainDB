Drag & drop the files 'consoleLog.txt', '/BepInEx/LogOutput.log' and 'exceptionLog.txt' (if it exists) from the folder '/Steam/SteamApps/common/Rain World/'. These logs get deleted or cleared when you launch the game. Send them after you encounter the issue.<br><br>[h1]FAQ[/h1]<br>[h3]Q1: The mod doesn't work. I can't open the mod's option menu. How to fix this?[/h3]<br>A1: Sometimes the mod is not initialized or applied correctly. You can re-apply it in the REMIX menu. Disable and enable the mod, and then press 'APPLY MODS'.<br>A2: One thing that helped multiple people is to delete the 'Rain World/BepInEx' folder and then verifying the integrity of the game files in Steam.<br>A3: Maybe this more extensive strategy works for you:<br>- Delete RW completely.<br>- Then deactivate downpour on steam client so it won't download.<br>- Install RW again.<br>- Apply all mods that you want in remix and test them<br>- Continue if they work now<br>- Activate downpour on steam so it would download<br>- Activate downpour mods in remix<br>- Reboot the game<br><br>[h3]Q2: The mod doesn't seem to work on Linux / SteamDeck. What can I do?[/h3]<br>A: You can try to add [b]WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winhttp=n,b' %command%[/b] to the launch options (in Steam: right click >> Properties >> General). After that, disable all mods, restart and then enable them again.<br>If that doesn't work there are other threads about Linux and SteamDeck on the [url=https://discord.gg/rainworld]Rain World Discord[/url] server.<br><br>[h3]Q3: The game freezes when entering a region. How to fix this?[/h3]<br>A: The game might actually not be frozen. The mod needs to generate files for each region. This can take time (>1 minute). Wait a bit. If the game actually crashed then you have an 'exceptionLog.txt' file in your Rain World folder. If that is the case then proceed with the section BUG REPORTS.<br><br>[h3]Q4: My game actually crashed. What happened?[/h3]<br>A: Your game might have run out of memory. So far I haven't found a solution to this. As a workaround, I recommend that you restart your game from time to time (see KNOWN ISSUES).<br><br>[h3]Q5: Some adjacent camera textures don't match visually.[/h3]<br>A: This is a technical limitation. The camera textures are generated by the game (vanilla) and just stitched together by this mod. This means that the perspective of them don't match. In some cases it is more noticeable than in others.<br><br>[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*]Some snow related shaders don't work correctly. In some places there is more snow than in vanilla and in other places less. Falling snow can 'jump' when you would have changed screens.<br>[*]This mod increases memory consumption. When the game runs low on memory the performance will decline and the game might crash. This might take a while (90+ minutes). It is recommended to restart the game every now and then.<br>CONTEXT: There might be memory leaks or memory fragmentation. A memory leak would mean that memory is not released when it is not used anymore. Fragmentation might happen because most roomCamera textures are now fairly large and change in size often. This means that they need to be re-allocated in memory often and they require a chunk of memory without 'holes'.<br>[*]Shadows at the edge of the screen seem to flicker or stretch in some rooms. I can see the same thing without camera scroll. Maybe a vanilla bug.<br>[*]Motion sickness might be a problem. I wonder how much is due to noise (details) in the textures. You can play around with the parameters and see what works for you.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1]SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG[/h1]<br>See the [url=https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll]GitHub page[/url] for this mod.<br><br>[h1] OLDER VERSIONS [/h1]<br>You can download any version from:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll/releases<br><br>Follow the installation instruction from:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll?tab=readme-ov-file#installation<br>",

The constant help is, well, helpful.<br><br>[h1][b]Explosive Daddy Long Legs[/b][/h1]<br>This variant of Daddy Long Legs can utilize a hyper-mutation that allows it to create explosions at it's tentacles, in order to stun them and catch prey easier. So, try not to get caught, if you want to live.<br><br>This creature cannot currently spawn in the base game, and you will have to manually spawn it in using the Arena, Beastmaster, or Dev Console.

Try your best not to get caught off-guard by the electrifying properties of this version of Daddy.<br><br>Same as the ELL, this can't spawn naturally, ect., ect.

Right now, it only does things regarding the ZLL mainly because I was worried about small performance issues and the possible unfairness of one of it's abilities, since it could reach you off-screen in a multi-screen room.

The three characters this mod adds should now be able to ascend, so players may beat the game as them if they wish.<br><br>[u]KNOWN ISSUES:[/u]<br>- Pebbles can talk to the characters without them having the Mark of Communication (and treats them like rivulet)<br>- Many regions do not have custom spawns<br><br>[u]PLANNED:[/u]<br>- More regions with custom spawns (currently only outskirts and shaded citadel have them)<br>- Edited saint rooms so the two characters can traverse them<br>- More Poacher crafting results<br>- Custom intro and ending cutscenes<br>- More custom LTTM and Pebbles Dialogue<br>- For Saint, Friend, and Poacher, a new subregion of Subterranean that connects it to Outer Expanse<br>- A new region which [spoiler]combines Silent Construct and the Rot (aka, Pebbles will be at the height of his rotting)[/spoiler]<br><br>[u]KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES:[/u]<br>Drainage System+ (drainage system doesnt get replaced in solace campaigns, makes ds lag out in solace campaigns)<br>Rebind Everything (makes Poacher unable to craft)<br>Simplified Moveset (makes Noircatto's wallclimbing break - will be fixed next update)<br>The BudGermination (prevents the game from loading)<br><br>[u]ATTRIBUTIONS:[/u]<br>A huge thank-you to Slime-Cubed, o645, Deathpits, Vigaro, Spinch, Fish, Bebe, forthfora, Dual Iron, Emerald Galaxy, and the rest of Rain World's modding community! Without you guys, creating this would not have been possible.

(Alternate control layout in Remix settings)<br><br>Slash has a combo mechanic.<br>It's damage formula is [code]0.2 + 0.2 * Combo multiplier[/code]<br>Combo always starts at 1, and is incremented with each sucessful hit, lasting for 3 seconds.<br>While doing a slide, or dropping from heights, Noir gets another temporary bonus of 2.<br><br>Noir does two hits when mauling. The first hit will deal up to 50% creature's current health (depending on their bite resistance).<br><br><br>Performing a slash during a flip results in a spin attack. This attack, unlike the standard slash, does not recoil if it hits a Lizard's head.<br><br>-------------------------Movement info:---------------------------<br><br>Pounce is directional and can be performed upwards and downwards, rather than just side-to-side.<br>Pounces and flips can be performed on top of horizontal poles.<br><br>Frontflips can be performed - the same way as you would do a backflip, but change direction again just before jumping. This is useful for using the flip-spin attack offensively.<br><br>When clinging to a wall, two small hops can be performed to 'wallclimb'.<br><br>-------------------------Extra Credits:-----------------------------<br><br>In-Game arts by: Elliot<br>Character design + Meme arts by: TeacupOfDOOM!!!<br>In-Game NoirCatto sprites by: Wolfycatt<br>Extra code: Aissurtievos<br>Additional programming help: Henpemaz, Slime_Cubed, forthfora<br>Online playtesting help: Pink<br>And many other wonderful members of Rain World modding community!<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This is a BETA of the character!<br>Please report any bugs you may find!<br><br>KNOWN BUGS:<br>- The sprites can occasionally glitch when using custom colors.

I think seeing the marks floating out of the head is funny.<br>Please just use default faces and change up color in character selections if you needed.<br>Special thank to Dual Iron for helping me with this mod!<br>Special thank to Venus Ring for animating assistance!<br><br>Version history:<br>1.0    pebbles and moon are available<br>1.1    platter fixs<br>1.3    added nsh and srs<br>1.3.1    fixed bug with sprites and make the head less funny when crawling<br>1.3.3    added some details for pebbles and moon, little bit sprites change<br>1.3.6    pebbles is now dressed<br>1.3.7	sprite fixes",

Please help by reporting weird behaviours.<br><br>Mod conflicts:<br>! Omnithrow and Aim Anywhere probably prevents this from working, please disable them as Aim Helper mod also provides the same ability of free aiming / vertical aiming.<br>!! Split-Screen mod is currently incompatible with the visuals module, it looks broken/duplicate visible lines but the actual snapping should work fine.<br><br>Ingame description:<br>Aim Helper allows you throw a weapon to any direction while holding direction inputs, if you release the inputs it defaults to horizontal.<br>Aim Helper also snaps your aim to a creature within customizable degrees of the throw direction.<br><br>I learned Rain World modding and c# just to make this mod, because I wanted to fix Omnithrow being sticky to the last input direction, and be able to do what Aim Anywhere does but with a Gamepad Controller instead of the mouse cursor.

(Basically 'aim smoothing')<br>* Per player toggle. (You get a checkbox, and they get a checkbox, everyone gets a checkbox)<br>* Check how it's possible to use advanced math for arc prediction.<br>* Check if it's possible to use devtools code for mouse input.<br>* Check how I can change spear properties on the fly to embed in ceilings and floors as if it was a backflipping throw.<br>* Put the mod on github, eventually, some day... (Lots of IRL events and priorities)<br><br>-Fixed missing screenshots that the Steam Workshop vanished mysteriously<br>Patch 5.0: Added legacy support for the older game version (v1.9.15b). (Special thanks to Slayer for helping me out)<br>Patch 4.9: Fixed the pointers that had broken with The Watcher game update. (They changed some creature name paths). Fixed an issue with visuals target background not displaying correctly.<br>Patch 4.8: Added option to hide direction line if there is a target.<br>Patch 4.7: Actually implement 'pointing always free aim' this time, even in vanilla mode. Refactored some internal pointers and checks<br>Patch 4.6: Added a check for avoiding snapping to friendly lizards and scavengers. Set direction color to also be the customized color.<br>Patch 4.5: Added new checks for camouflaged enemies and darkness.

"desc": "[h1]Introduction[/h1]<br>The Outsider is an overly flashy slugcat, or rather a distant relative of the slugcat. It possesses the genes of winged insects, which allows it to obtain biological fluorescence and flight ability, but also makes the Spore Puffs fatal to it.<br>﻿<br>1. The Outsider can fly. When in the air, hold down the jump button to flap your wings. The first flap of wings after each liftoff does not consume food points, but each subsequent flap will consume 1/4 of food points.<br>2. The Outsider can flare. When standing on the ground, holding down both the pick and jump buttons will consume 1 food point to release a flare.<br>3. The Outsider is a vegetarian animal. It cannot consume any meat, but as compensation, it can swallow more types of plants to obtain satiety, such as Bubble Weed, Flashbang, etc. [spoiler]But Spore Puffs is POISONOUS, and consuming it will immediately cause the outsider to die. Please don't blame it, there are no Spore Puffs in The Outsider's hometown, and The Outsider, like you, didn't know this at first.[/spoiler]<br>﻿<br>I hope you will find these abilities useful... because it has to try to survive in a dark and gloomy world.<br><br><br>[h1]Credits[/h1]<br>[h3]Code: [/h3]<br>Quaeledy<br>[h3]Art: [/h3]<br>Quaeledy<br>[h3]Other: [/h3]<br>Special thanks to Harvie and Pkuyo for their help and advice. Thanks to those who participated in the testing, they are: Wings Echo, ArcticTern, Fei, Fancy cat, Black Cat o.o, Xue Wan, Fi.<br>This is the first mod I wrote, so there may be many bugs that I haven't discovered yet. If you find it, please let me know. Apologize in advance for any possible bugs, hope you enjoy it!<br>﻿<br><br>[h1]Known issues[/h1]<br>1. Sometimes Jolly Coop will replace the character controlled by the player with a survivor. You only need to switch back to the outsider in the Jolly Coop.<br>2. Conflict with The BudGermination. Simultaneously enabling The Outsider and The BudGermination will result in The Outsider being disabled by the game.<br><br>﻿<br>[h1]Notes[/h1]<br>I used a translator to write this introduction, so there may be some descriptions that are incorrect.<br>You can customize its color in the JOLLY CO-OP. I made some modifications to the world map, and also modified the generation of creatures in each region to align them with the current timeline. But there are currently no new endings.<br>There are almost no new storylines. I am also considering the issue of balance, please don't worry.<br>The two rooms in the new area you saw by the warp menu are LTTM's rooms, which I used for testing. They are not the rooms I will eventually use.<br>This is the first mod I wrote, so there may be many bugs that I haven't discovered yet. If you find it, please let me know. Apologize in advance for any possible bugs, hope you enjoy it!<br>Additionally, I initially only wanted to play my own OC in the game, so I created this mod. Just to fit my OC timeline, I modified the world. So perhaps it won't achieve the completion level of the campaign in the game, please don't have too high expectations for it.<br>Due to Steam restrictions, I am unable to reply to comments. I am very sorry for this.<br>If you wish to create a video for this mod, you do not need my consent.<br><br><br>[h1]Updates[/h1]<br>[h3][2024.3.19][/h3]<br>Just bugs fixing and antenna dynamic optimization. This mod is my earliest work, full of various bugs. I want to complete it, but I lack time and energy, so please don't expect too much.<br>[h3][2024.8.19][/h3]<br>Just bugs fixing.<br>[h3][2024.10.27] ver 0.2.11[/h3]<br>1. Added Mothpups (Outsider pups). Mothpups can only be naturally generated and generated using the Dev Console on the timeline of Outsider, and can be generated using Beast Master on other lines and in sandbox modes;<br>2. Added DMS (Dress My Slugcat) adaptation for antennae, wings, and tail speckles for Outsider and Mothpup;<br>3. Added UI adaptation for Jolly-Coop;<br>4. Fixed the erroneous animations of flight and swallowtail.<br>[h3][2024.10.28] ver 0.2.12[/h3]<br>1. Added the “dressmyslugcat/outsidertemple” folder to the outsider mod folder as an example of using DMS to customize outsider parts.<br>2. Added an option in remix settings to make mothpups appear in other campaigns that can generate slugpups. Mothpups will replace other slugpups for generation, and you can customize the probability of this replacement.<br>[h3][2025.2.23] ver 0.2.13[/h3]<br>1. Fixed conflicts with Random Buff.<br>2. Modified the way Mothpup is generated using Dev Console. Now all you need to do is enter 'spawn Mothpup', and 'spawn SlugNPC' can no longer generate Mothpup.<br>3. Fixed the issue where Slugpup still has 1 satiety left at the beginning of the next cycle after starving and eating again (instead of deducting all satiety). (It should be noted here that this is Rain World's own problem, not The Outsider's problem.)<br>4. Improved Mothpup's pathfinding method.<br>[h3][2025.4.7] ver 0.2.14[/h3]<br>Support basic game v1.10.1.<br>[h3][2025.4.9] ver 0.2.15[/h3]<br>1. Fixed the issue in v1.10.1 where the prompt did not take effect.<br>2. Adjusted the horizontal flight speed in v1.10.1.<br>[h3][2025.4.10] ver 0.2.16[/h3]<br>1. Fixed the issue of Mothpup causing the game to freeze.<br>2. Attempt to fix the issue of Mothpup causing the game to not load.<br>[h3][2025.4.19] ver 0.2.17[/h3]<br>1. Balance adjustment. Modified the speed and altitude of the flight.<br>2. Added adaptation to new foods in The Watcher DLC:<br>(1) [spoiler]The Outsider has a lower probability of stun and a shorter duration of stun when consuming decaying plants, and can earn more food points.[/spoiler]<br>(2) [spoiler]The Outsider can directly gnaw on pomegranates without having to drop them to the ground and crack them.[/spoiler]<br>[h3][2025.4.19] ver 0.2.18[/h3]<br>1. Slightly adjusted takeoff speed and lateral descent speed.<br>2. Now the Remix configuration menu can configure the flight and flash buttons for players 1 to 4.<br>3. Now it is possible to set SwallowTail and its speckled sprites in DMS.<br>[h3][2025.4.21] ver 0.2.19[/h3]<br>1. Deleted some output logs belonging to The Outsider to reduce the impact on performance.<br>2. Added an adaptation to new creatures in The Watcher DLC: [spoiler]Big Moths[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Small Moths[/spoiler] are more friendly and tolerant towards The Outsider and Mothpups.<br>[h3][2025.8.14] ver 0.2.20[/h3]<br>Fixed the issue where the game froze when slugcat that was not The Outsider picked up Pomegranate.<br>[h3][2025.11.1] ver 0.2.21[/h3]<br>Update to adaptive game version 1.11.3.",

Many beasts are stronger than one may think however, so make sure to stay sharp in case they reawaken after mauling.<br>Now, the most important change, forcing the new gameplay style: <br>[b]You cannot throw spears.[/b] At all, which may cause some difficulties in combat and traversal...<br><br>[h1] Features [/h1] <br>This Owl-Approved mod contains:<br>[list]<br>[*] A new sub-region with wonderfully crafted new screens in Industrial Complex from myself and other region makers like Oscarriaq.

It's easy to remember, and it's close to what color Teensies actually are.<br><br>The Globox and Globox reskin use stilted sprites. This means they look taller, but have the same hitbox. This could cause long jumps to feel weird, and for his eyes to look a bit wonky(But when aren't they?).<br><br>Globox and Rayman skins use their head sprite for their chest pattern. This is so it can face and follow their prospective. If there's any modded weirdness occurring from this, it's not on me! (Such as being revived with the mod Revivify. This causes their chest pattern to dealign, but it's minor.)<br><br>I didn't add a Barbra costume, as she's not really 'Default' in Rayman Legends. That, and she would be a bit  C O M P L I C A T E D  to pixelate.<br><br>Speaking of not adding characters, I will not be adding Rabbids, as they don't appear in any mainline Rayman game.

I tried to fix it 3 times, but Rain World expects mostly symmetrical heads.<br><br>The Teensy costume works fine as a pup, for the most part. The arms detach when hanging from a pole however.<br><br>The 'Stun' state on the eyes/face of the grey scale costumes also reflect the chosen eye/face color when they are meant to be white. If the eye/face color is set to black or similar dark color, the 'Suprised' expression appears wrong.<br><br>Rayman is too cute, everything wants to eat him up.<br><br>______________________________________________________________<br>TROUBLESHOOTING -<br><br>If the costumes don't appear in game, here's a few things you can try.<br><br>* Get the Dress My Slugcat mod.<br>This mod is required for the reading and loading of the vast majority of cosmetic mods.<br><br>* Remember to enable your mods!<br>Hehe, I've done this before.<br><br>* Try reloading your atlases.<br>Within the 'Get Fancy' option on the main menu, there's a 'Reload atlases' button on the lower right of the screen.<br><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>DISCLAIMER:<br><br>This mod does not add sound effects!

Whenever they try to bite, they release an slight shock that arcs between their teeth (in game this is shown as a one shot to most slugcats). As a side effect of the electricity, they are very energetic and are very fast.<br><br>[h1] Magenta Lizards [/h1](Time: Rivulet, Found anywhere with pink lizards. Can also be found in outer expanse in gourmand.)<br>Due to evolutionary pressure, some pink lizards have evolved into magenta lizards. These lizards are slightly stronger, faster and can see farther. Due to the dark coloration of the environment, they have evolved a much darker colo(u)ration. <br><br>[h1] Tangerine Lizards [/h1](Time: Spearmaster, Rivulet and Saint, Found in the Sky Islands and the Exterior)<br>A truly interesting lizard, the tangerine lizard exists as both a crossbreed between cyan and orange lizards and the ancestor of the two.

They will take more than a few spears to take down this lizard!<br><br>[h1] Sky Blue Lizard [/h1](Time: Rivulet, Found in Sky Islands and Industrial Complex.)<br>A evolution of blue lizards which have evolved gas propulsion in their tails due to dormant cyan genes. In addition they have quite a long tail and fast reflexes. They are quite a magnificent sight to behold!<br><br>[h1] Cherry Lizard [/h1](Time: Saint, Found in Silent Construct.)<br>An evolution of the strawberry lizards. They have inherited antennae due to orange heritage, and they hunt in groups. As a result of their slightly tinier, more rotund bodies, they can move very fast with their tongues. Due to all of this, they can surround prey quick and quickly attack those who harm the pack.<br><br>[h1] Raspberry Lizard [/h1](Time: Saint, Found in Silent Construct.)<br>A crossbreed between a red lizard and a strawberry lizard.

There are a number of limitations & bugs. Use at your own risk.[/h3]<br><br>[h3]Description[/h3]<br>A mod that adds Pokéballs. When a creature is hit with one, there's a chance it can be captured. When a ball hits a wall or other creature, the contained creature will release. Pokéballs have a 60% chance of spawning in scavenger treasuries. If a Pokéball spawns, theres a 20% chance for it to become a Greatball (increased capture chance), and a 1% chance for a Masterball (100% capture chance). Also watch out for scavengers, as they are expert Pokémon trainers (and will catch you). <br><br>Pokéballs will only tame creatures that are already tamable. <br>Needs Fisobs to work. Has an options menu. Also source code included for those who like spaghetti. <br>Spawn with Dev Console using this command: 'spawn_raw PokeballAbstract Greatball' <br><br>© Pokemon Pokeball belongs to Nintendo / Gamefreak / The Pokémon Company <br><br>[h3]Possibly in the future?[/h3]<br>- Break Pokéball if capture failed. <br>- Trading rare creatures with Scavengers to get higher reputation. <br>- More color/types of Pokéballs with different capture chances & features. <br>- Crafting Pokéballs as Gourmand? <br>- Pokémon battles with scavengers. Pokémon battle events? Free toll passthrough if player wins. <br>- Tame all creatures. (probably not because i think this is way too complex) <br>- Better Jolly Co-op support if possible. <br><br>[h3]Known bugs/issues[/h3]<br>- Slugpup relationships are removed entirely if they are kept in a Pokéball for too long, or during hibernation. Their food pips will first blink and later disappear. Release slugpups in shelters, or you need to get to know each other again as if you met for the first time. <br>- Creature relationships (if available) are not stored, instead they are reset to fully friendly. <br>- Releasing Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. <br>- Pokéball doesn't like rolling up slopes. It gets stuck on edges. <br>- If you time it right and throw a Pokéball at a DLL while it's eating, creatures can get stuck to DLLs in a unknown state upon release. <br>- Pokéball button light sometimes misaligned when carried. <br>- An exception might occur if a Pokéball hits certain projectiles mid-air (spitter spider dart). But this shouldn't cause problems afaik. <br>- Using Warp Menu will often change >something?< that will make you throw Pokéballs against yourself. <br><br>[h3]Player bugs/issues[/h3]<br>- Releasing a player from a Pokéball while there's a creature (Hazer) in its stomach freezes the game. <br>- Make sure players are not stuck in Pokéballs when hibernating, because that is counted as a player death. Restoring players after hibernating is undefined behavior. <br>- Getting carried into a den when you're inside a Pokéball won't trigger a death. You will need to manually restart. <br>- If you're stored in a Pokéball, and a scavenger carries you to a gate, the gate will actually activate, but the game will freeze. <br>- Pokéball camera tracking if player is stored is unreliable and doesn't work correctly with multi screen rooms. <br><br>[h3]Reporting[/h3]<br>Please report any bug, problem, change or feature request via the Discussions, or message me on the Rain World Discord ( https://discord.gg/rainworld ): @.maximol <br>If reporting a problem, also include the steps to recreate it & the following file(s): <br>- 'exceptionLog.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/exceptionLog.txt) <br>- 'LogOutput.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt) <br>",

The semi-plant cell structure allows it to perform photosynthesis in the wild, use the mimic tail to attract bat flies, and camouflage.<br><br>【Ability】<br>+ Photosynthesis: Staying in open-air areas in the wild can slowly restore satiety through photosynthesis.<br>+ Prey Attraction: Bat flies will be attracted and actively approach.<br>+ Mimic camouflage: When lying down or crawling forward, it will enter a hidden state, which is not easy to be found by predators in this state.<br>+ Karma protection: In the state of full food, long press ↑ + pick up button can consume all food to get a karma level protection.<br>+ Very cute: Similar is an unbelievably cute slugcat and suitable for everyone!!<br><br>【Other】<br>Similar was born on Sky Island and has weaker physical fitness. The timeline and environment of its current life are similar to those of Monk.<br>Mod will continue to be updated in the future, and Similar may have more new mechanisms, plots and more original content.<br>Thank you for your love and support for this mod, and welcome your comments and feedback.<br><br>【Known issues】<br>1.

New ability: eating karma flower can directly increase the level of karma under the condition of existing karma protection (you can choose to enable/disable on the configuration page)<br>2. New mechanism: the attack in the camouflage state will remove the camouflage (you can choose to enable/disable on the configuration page)<br>3.

If you have better suggestions or changes, I will consider it when I have a higher level of programming (no.jpg)<br>If there is a bug (hope there will be less x), please try to bring the exceptionLog file in the root directory of the Rain World game, thank you!<br><br>From Carbontea:<br>Similar was originally the original slug cat oc I designed in 2018.<br>Similar is inspired by the red grass that can attract bat flies in the game, the mimic pole and some plants that hunt insects in reality. Because Rain World gives people the impression of danger, so I let this slug cat evolve the ability of mimicry and camouflage, and the semi-vegetative structure allows it to acquire the characteristics of photosynthesis and attracting bats.<br>I am very grateful to Teacher Xue Mian for making this design a reality after 5 years! I hope everyone likes Similar, anyway, I already like it to death.",

Fully credit to Ratrat44 for the mods used to make this possible![/b] <br><br><br>[h1] Current Lizards (in order) [/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*][b]Apple Lizard (RED_PINK)[/b]: Apple Lizards are predominantly pack hunters, but have been known to cooperate with Artillery Lizards. They possess a gall bladder able of producing a small amount of mucus per cycle, which they can spit in focused jets. However, this can leave them vulnerable to a counterattack.<br><br>[*][b]Artillery Lizard (RED_PINK)[/b]: Artillery Lizards were created as a purposed organism designed to curb creature counts. They are both heavily armoured and highly stun resistant, with the ability to distil fire powder bombs from within their own stomach.<br><br>[*][b]Blueberry Lizard (LIGHT_BLUE)[/b]: A lizard known to slugcats, originating from beyond the facility grounds. Blueberry lizards are passive towards slug cats, but are laughably weak and possess the ability to spit swallowed debris when in danger.<br><br>[*][b]Corpse Lizard (GREY)[/b]: Corpses reanimated by vast hordes of spiders, these bodies hunt to feed the hive inside them.<br><br>[*][b]Cicada Lizard (SQUIDCADA)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Dragon Lizard (HOT_PINK)[/b]: As a creature originating from the depths below the world, Dragon Lizards possess some dangerous traits. They can use void fluid stored in their stomach to fire a volley of firebug eggs each cycle, and are capable of propelling themselves through the air.<br><br>[*][b]Gator Lizard (SEAWEED)[/b]: A coastal variant of the green lizard, gators have stronger muscles and less weight, allowing them to climb poles and dive beneath the waves.<br><br>[*][b]Hive Lizard (RED_ORANGE)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Nightmare Lizard (PITCH_BLACK)[/b]: A lethal underwater predator, Nightmare lizards have adapted to the murky depths and only rely on touch and sound alone to navigate. Their lethal bite, acute hearing and the upper hand in the water should not be underestimated. [b]Oh yeah, and it's almost unkillable.[/b]<br><br>[*][b]Infant Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: An infant lizard known for its extreme aggression. They don't survive very long away from their mother.<br><br>[*][b]Mature Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: A slow-moving predator, capable of storing its young inside a pocket concealed within its mouth, not unlike a crocodile. It weaponises its children as a means to catch prey.<br><br>[*][b]Spitter Lizard (DARK_RED)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Spore Lizard (WHITE_GREEN)[/b]: A variant of lizard, overtaken by fungal spores. It has gained the ability to spit hardened pellets that explode in gas clouds, multiple times on impact. They tend to prey on insects, and will flee from any other creature it perceives as a threat.<br><br>[*][b]Fire Lizard (ORANGE)[/b]: With a diet of firebugs, fire lizards are a dangerous predator, being able to expel fire spears at an alarming rate.<br><br>[*][b]Infested Lizard (BROWN)[/b]: Victims of contaminated water in the vast wastes below Five Pebbles, Infested lizards are nothing more than hosts.<br>[/list]<br><br><br>[i]This is my first actual mod, so feedback is very much appreciated! <3[/i]",

"desc": "My reinterpretations of canon slugcats are (very) slowly coming to life. Currently, only Artificer, Rivulet, Spearmaster, and their grayscale versions are available (with a bonus surprise).<br>They're based on various species of nudibranches mixed with a few other inspirations, for whom it may be interesting. <br><br>[b]PLEASE READ:[/b]<br>- This is my first time ever doing something like this. I'd love to hear what you guys think of this little passion project of mine. Also the skins might look goofy in specific poses, but it's bound to happen to anything more complex than a single color silhouette.<br><br>- Toggle asymmetry for every fancy tail texture. Recommended tail length about 6-8. Rivulet's tail looks best slimmer.<br><br>- Arti and Riv do not use extras (gills, scar).<br><br>- Spearmaster's grayscale skin shares the same face sprites as their colorful counterpart. Which means you have to set the face the same color as your body color. It's the way it is due to SM's long head, and most face sprites don't sit right on it in certain angles. I will change every skin accordingly once DMS layer function comes to existence.<br><br>- [strike]The rest of the slugcats will definitely come before the end of this summer. I'm just struggling with multiple other projects + personal worms in my brain.[/strike] UPDATE: things in life got a little rough, so I'm afraid I can't keep my promise. Oops!<br><br>[b]CURRENT PROGRESS OF THE UNRELEASED SKINS:[/b]<br>- Hunter and Gourmand are almost done, they're missing 50% of the head sprites.<br><br>- Survivor, Saint and Monk are close to being done, they're missing 80% of the head sprites.<br><br>- Nightcat and ??? are at early stages of making.",

This also allows them to jump slightly higher as well as sprint faster, though they are not as agile as the infamous Rivulet. It also means they can Squidcada Hover without needing to starve!<br><br>They start off with a natural glow that aids them through dark areas, as well as the Mark of Communication.<br>With the help of their extra arms, they are capable of throwing a spear that deals more damage than usual in order to defend themselves, which comes in handy when the world they find themselves in is littered with dangerous enemies...<br>Reputation is low and will need to be recovered manually.<br><br>They require 5 food to hibernate while being able to store 10 total. Plants give less food than usual, as they are mainly carnivorous. However, certain foods will fill much more hunger than usual, with their favorite food being Eggbug and Firebug Eggs and especially anything with a glow to it. When starving, their stats severely decrease to being comparable to The Monk.<br><br>Lastly, the Ascendant starts off in Rubicon, and currently uses Rivlet's worldstate.<br>[spoiler](Post-Rivulet, Pre-Saint.)[/spoiler]<br>[spoiler]If you happen to load the mod without Downpour, Ascendant will instead use Hunter's worldstate as a failsafe, starting in Shaded Citadel.[/spoiler]<br><br>[b][u]I highly recommend you set the tail settings to the following in Dress My Slugcat, for the best experience:[/u]<br>[i]Asymmetry<br>5 to 6 Length<br>2.0 Wideness<br>0.1 Roundness[/i][/b]<br><br><br>[h1]Known Issues[/h1]<br>- Characters are only capable of achieving the ascending endings, as no custom campaigns are made for them.<br>- Characters may be a bit unbalanced at the moment, I'm tweaking these constantly. Ascendant specifically will have a major nerf once their crafting is added.<br>- Sometimes certain sprites appear to white out into triangles, this may be a Dress My Slugcat issue. Reloading Atlases or reinstalling the mod tends to fix this.<br>- Custom spawns are unfinished, check the mods change notes to know which ones have custom spawns for now. I'll remove this note once all regions are finished.<br>- Sea Serpent does not naturally spawn anywhere in the current patch, but can be used in Arena Mode.<br>- [spoiler]Two modified versions of the Blue Lizard are accessible in Arena Mode, these are meant to be used for The Copycat's campaign which will begin once spawns for The Ascendant are finished.[/spoiler]<br><br><br>[h1]To Do[/h1]<br>- [strike]Add Arena Mode sprites.[/strike]<br>- [strike]Add unique in-game sprites.[/strike]<br>- Add Death artwork.<br>- [strike]Add Sleeping artwork.[/strike]<br>- Add Ascended artwork.<br>- [strike]Add Title Screen artwork.[/strike]<br>- [strike]Add Selection Screen artwork.[/strike]<br>- Add Custom Ascension Ending cutscene.<br>- [u][b]Finish adding custom spawns to every Region[/b][/u].<br>- Give Ascendant limited crafting for void/light based objects.<br><br><br>[h1]Future playables[/h1]<br>- The Vorpal?<br>- The Siren?<br>- The Copycat?

Since the mod doesn't have any mechanic dependencies from Downpour yet, it is theoretically possible to play it with the base game. Though I highly recommend against this as it will probably only cause the mod to break later on once abilities such as crafting are added.",

"desc": "[h3]Description[/h3]<br>Tool which allows dragging creatures/objects outside sandbox-mode using your mouse, also known as the Sandbox Mouse. Includes options to pause, destroy, duplicate, tame, stun, teleport, cut/paste, safari-control, kill & revive individual creatures, players and objects. Also allows you to activate and throw items like bombs and spears. Press right mouse button on an object or the background to open one of two radial menus. Hold left control (default) to select multiple objects, or to use a selection-rectangle. While dragging use the scroll wheel to rotate objects. <br><br>Credits:<br>- Fyre & Noir for the BeastMaster menu trianglemesh code <br>- IdleFire Guardian for playtesting <br>- heerxingen for Simplified Chinese translation <br>- CreativeGamer03 for help with DeepL placeholder translations <br><br>Source code is here: https://github.com/woutkolkman/mousedrag <br>If you see any mistakes in the translations you'd like to see fixed, it would be helpful to create a pull request with corrections for the translation file: https://github.com/woutkolkman/mousedrag/tree/master/MouseDrag/bin/mousedrag/text <br><br>[h3]Known issues/bugs[/h3]<br>- Pausing a deer while you're on it will make you slide off. You need to jump to be able to move again. <br>- When cut/pasting a player in/to arena, if there's a creature in their stomach (Hazer), it is deleted. This happens because of limitations when deserializing a creature. <br>- When cut/pasting objects, many objects will ignore the new position and spawn back on their old position in a new room. This is determined by how the object is programmed. <br>- Cut/pasting Oracles (iterator puppets) has a VERY HIGH chance of crashing the game. Also, their sprites will not be removed immediately. <br>- Pasting Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. <br>- If Jolly Co-op is enabled in story-mode, you cannot safari-control slugpups or follow slugpups with the RoomCamera. <br>- After returning from a safari-controlled creature and the player room was reloaded, you cannot open your map. Jolly Co-op will keep the player's room loaded and prevent this from happening. <br><br>[h3]Reporting[/h3]<br>Please report any bug, problem, change or feature request via the Discussions, or message me on the Rain World Discord ( https://discord.gg/rainworld ): @.maximol <br>If reporting a problem, also include the steps to recreate it & the following file(s): <br>- 'exceptionLog.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/exceptionLog.txt) <br>- 'LogOutput.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt) <br>",

If they consume an explosive whilst burnt out, it removes that status effect.<br>Estranged can switch back fron being charged under the same conditions that they could become charged.

For unknown reasons, you have fallen from the cosmic space onto this planet, where the Rain World is unfolding, temporarily losing most of your cosmic abilities. You need to visit the echoes of the ancestors and collect fragments of stars to regain your lost abilities and find a way back to the universe.<br><br>Features:<br><br>The cosmic ghost has the ability to create cosmic items and manipulate time and space.<br>All skills have related settings in the mod config interface.<br>Unique ending.<br><br>Starting Abilities:<br><br>1. Starrealm Spear Crafting:<br>Spend 1 hunger to convert any spear into a Starrealm Spear using cosmic energy. The Starrealm Spear can instantly kill any creature it hits and reverts to a normal spear after use.<br>2. Singularity Bomb Crafting:<br>Spend 2 hunger to combine two rocks into a Singularity Bomb using cosmic energy. The user is immune to the effects of the Singularity Bomb.<br>3. Ghost Form:<br>In situations with zero gravity, the character transforms into a semi-transparent ghost form, immune to the influence of any creatures or the environment.<br><br>Abilities to Restore:<br><br>1. Gravity Control:<br>Unlocked upon when you saw five pebbles, it allows you to spend 1 hunger to change the gravity in the current room for 30 seconds. If you change rooms, the new room will also be affected.<br>2. Time Freeze:<br>Unlocked when reaching the maximum Gravitational Force limit. Activating this ability immobilizes all creatures except for yourself for approximately 6 seconds, with a cooldown of 45 seconds.<br>3. Space Teleportation:<br>A new element involving the collection of Star Fragments, similar in appearance to sandbox collectibles. After collecting one in each area, you unlock the ability to set teleportation gates in the current area. These gates allow you to teleport between areas with a cooldown of 30 seconds and a 6-second activation delay, during which you can be interrupted by other creatures.<br>4. Time Reversal:<br>Unlocked after collecting all Star Fragments in every area. When activated, time starts to reverse, and the states of objects and creatures revert to previous conditions. This can be triggered after death and can be used multiple times in one cycle, depending on the current Gravitational Force level.<br>5. Space-Time Travel:<br>Aquired after completing the ending.

(note: the longer they are a scug the more they forget about this previous life).<br><br>(Regular part)<br>After her new slugcat family was killed while her body was still in childhood, she was adopted by scavengers for some time before eventually being sent to live with the first responsible slugcats they found.<br><br>Her first relationship went well, and she was gifted her bracelet from her lover, and all was well until her lover ended her own life. She decided to travel to avoid the bad memories, eventually finding another slugcat colony, where she met a new partner, this one male, and they became life mates, her partner gifting her the purple pearl necklace.<br><br>They had four children: a boy, a pair of twin boy and girl, and finally a girl. Her youngest child, disabled from birth, wore a red scarf. She eventually got so focused caring for everyone else that she ended up accidentally neglecting her eldest, who then disappeared to tame a huge number of lizards. She left a note in his room apologising and asking to make amends.<br><br>One day, she went hunting for the colony's food, only to find the entire colony killed at the hands of lizards - controlled by her scorned eldest son. As she walked back into the colony, she saw the remains of her youngest, and took her scarf to wear in her memory. Every step over the corpses of family and friends felt like walking on blades. She decided that the only way to curb her son's rage would be to silence him herself.<br><br>She saw him reading the note, a pained expression on his face, then he looked up to her, as she was standing over him with a menacing aura. During their ensuing battle, she gained what would become many of her scars, and the rare acid-spitting lizards her son had in his pack were able to sear her right eye off with acid...<br><br>...but in doing so, she manifested the power to create a Soul Harpoon.<br>She used her new weapon, forged from the souls of her loved ones she had now realised she had absorbed, to slay the lizards and her son, and decided that the only way to spare herself of this pain would be to give up on relationships entirely. Along this path, she developed a hatred and hunger for lizards. (note: this hatred is not as severe as Artificer's hatred of scavs).<br><br>The scavengers around her gave their utmost respect, branding the mark of the Dragon Slayer into her arms as a ceremonial status symbol. She would later find a lost slugpup, adopting it for her own, but was unable to save them when they ran towards scavengers curiously... with a spear in their hands. The scavengers immediately regretted striking the pup down when they saw her, though she refused to kill them despite her hurt and their offers to die in retribution, as she understood why. A pack of lizards appearing left her with only one option for escape - throwing her child's corpse as an edible distraction.<br><br>She blames herself for everything.<br><br>and there yah gooo!!<br><br>BUT PLEASE SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS AND PEOPLE WHO MADE THE ART SHOWCASED IN THE MOD!

Does not like fairy lizards.<br>BugLizard - A small insect-like lizard that shoots beehives, will eat grass lizards.<br>DragonLizard - A big lizard that are usually in open areas. Get in line of sight and you're dead.<br>FairyLizard - A friendly lizard that shoots balls of light(flashbang but this is cooler).<br>FightingLizard - Basically a red lizard but redder and meaner without the tongue and spit ability.<br>FlyingLizard - A lizard that can fly across rooms, gave me a jumpscare before.<br>GhostLizard - A pale lizard that doesn't do much but most creatures are afraid of it.<br>GrassLizard - A fluffy lizard that shoots puffballs, great insect killer (yes ik bug is supposed to have advantage). Hunted by Bug Lizards.<br>GroundLizard - A dirty lizard that can charge at you(I think?) and spit mud(not really mud) to push you off poles.<br>IceLizard - A big cold lizard that are usually in the winter. Can slide across rooms quickly if nothing is in the way.<br>MysteryLizard - ???<br>PoisonLizard - Can put its opponents to sleep.<br>PsychicLizard - Has leap and antennae ability, can also shoot void bullets.<br>RockLizard - A sturdy lizard that shoots rocks, high tendency to lounge.<br>SteelLizard - An even more sturdy lizard that.... shoots rocks very fast. (I like to think of it as bullets and that it's a machine gun, I'd put spears instead but Underhang is hard enough as it is.)<br>NormalLizard - A small and basic lizard that lounges at its prey from short distances, has good hearing.

Despite this, fanged lizards are quite cowardly, running or evading any creature that exceeds them in size even if they are in pack.<br>However, everything changes when they have a Great fanged lizard with them, being the equivalent of the alpha male of the specie, despite being slower and stupider than their small counterpart, It makes up for it with a greater ferocity, resistance and a much more powerful paralyzing venom that allows it to confront even vultures, even it roar is much more powerful, allowing it to command their entire pack and giving them a security and ferocity that makes them even more aggressive than the Great fanged lizard themselves, they have also learned to infuse their saliva with their venom, so be very careful.<br>If anyone wants to put them in a custom region, don't be shy about asking me.<br>I hope you like them!<br><br>'this mod was possible thanks to M4rbleL1ne help'<br>",

This is particularly noticeable when moving from the standing to the crouching pose.<br>- Backflips and rolls look a bit odd because Legcat doesn't rotate during them.<br>- Your hitbox is slightly larger than your sprite. Beware of headshots!<br>- Pole climbing causes the legcat to kind of merge with the pole, going behind it, and causes the tail to detach.

The snow kept getting deeper, and Looks To The Moon's rarefraction cell was not enough to keep out the cold. She finds the Fathomless, a slugcat unable to stay on land for too long. The Fathomless understands her situation and searches even deeper below Looks To The Moon's submerged superstructure. (The region will be called Mechanical Ocean, and I will add it once I start working on the slugcats). The Fathomless will search for all of Looks To The Moon's lost rarefraction cells, and will hopefully come back in one piece. There are dangerous and unforeseen creatures in those ocean depths. [/spoiler]<br><br>-The Forgotten: [spoiler] 'In the beginning, there was darkness. In the end, there will be light.' A slugcat is trying its best to survive in changing times. A new cycle has started at the tail end of the ice age. One of complete darkness. This Slugcat is completely blind, and I will try to implement things like echolocation that reveals your location to the creatures of the dark. [/spoiler]<br><br><br><br>I will try to add music all made by me, but I might not get to that.<br><br>Future Plans:<br>-Two slugcats with unique story-lines. I have come to realize that other campaigns come close to my own. I assure you that I came up with these ideas on my own and I am not copying anyone else. I'm really sorry if your mod is like mine.<br>-More rooms, more regions!<br>-Connect my region to the actual world.<br>-Custom music<br>-Custom creatures.<br>-Custom endings, cut-scenes, and maybe dreams.<br><br>This is my first mod and I would really appreciate any help or suggestions you have.<br><br>Warning;<br>-Forgotten Pathway's karma gate is not only non-functional but also crashes on use.<br>-This region is a W.I.P. and is subject to constant updates.<br>-I have other things to do with my life so I might not answer comments immediately.<br>-Adding slugcats might be too difficult for me, because I don't know C#. Don't hold your breath for these campaigns. I might just end with the two regions.<br>-Sorry for the lack of backgrounds in my rooms. I'm definately not going to re-render rooms FO_A01 to FO_A03. I've given up on those ones. I'm going to fix the random cliff in FO_A04 tho.<br><br><br>Good News:<br><br>-I'm currently working on the slugcats. (Majorly confusing tho. I'm bad at programming.) ",

"desc": "This mod provides more graphical layers you can use when editing the Sofanthiel Dating Simulator. It adds two new spots for graphics to spice up the look of your mod. And another action to control the music.<br><br>HOW TO USE:<br>If you don't already know how to edit the visual novel, it's VERY easy to reverse engineer. Just go into the 'content' folder of the More Slugcats Expansion files (C:rogram Files (x86)teamteamappsommonain WorldainWorld_DatatreamingAssetsodsoreslugcatsontent). All the files involved in the Dating Simulator (except for the code) are in there. Make sure to also head to the Modding Wiki to learn about the basics of Rain World modding in general.<br>Now that you either already know or just figured out how to mod the Dating Simulator, in order to use the new changes, the text files that you add must end with '_exp.txt'. If they don't, it won't use the modified engine and nothing will happen. So, if your mod has a file named 'modstart.txt', it must be changed to 'modstart_exp.txt'.<br>Now for the new graphic layers, it works like the two portraits for the Inv and the other slugcat. The lines in the text file for the new layers are just under those for the originals. I call them 'overlay' (3rd line) and 'textbar' (4th line). The anchor point (aka middle) for overlay is in the center of the screen and textbar's center is on the middle point of the dialogue text. You can guess the original purpose for them by their names, there's even some assets provided for textbar in this mod's files, check them out or create your own. But feel free to use them however you wish.<br>Now for the new music command: Mute. If you put 'MUTE' in the music control line of the text file, instead of doing a smooth fade to silence, the track that's currently playing will abruptly stop when the file is loaded. That's it.<br><br>If you are still confused, check out my other mod (Hunger Games Simulator), it's where the code originally came from. Feel free to snoop around the files of that mod for examples.<br>And if you would like to contact me, here's my Discord username:<br>@jrthekidRS",

Leaving NSH's room will cause the game to crash. <br>2. In [Collection], if you unlock all collections in MSC settings and click on the broadcast of NSH region that was not collected in the game, it will cause the game to crash. (This seems to be an issue from CRS)<br>3. When using the Warp Menu to teleport to the SB-OE karma gate, attempting to teleport to the gate in the OE region before attempting to teleport to the gate in the SB region will cause the game to report an error and fail to teleport.<br>4. This mod also considers Lancer's hunter as the Hunter. <br>5. Gates Scanner will cause [spoiler]a pearl in a performance of this mod to move to the wrong position[/spoiler], but this is not very important.<br>6. When viewing the map of NSH region in the [Region] menu, the slugcat avatar will display incorrectly.<br>7. When both Guardian and Palette Creator are enabled simultaneously, an error will be reported, but it will not affect the game process.<br>8. Sometimes, when you have played for too long, the game may crash when playing the new ending scenes. Afterwards, you can reopen the game and continue playing normally, although you may miss the scenes of the new ending.<br>9. The reason is not yet clear, however, Slugcats whose OE has collapsed may not be able to trigger the road to NSH. It may be related to mod conflicts.<br><br><br>[h1]Notes: [/h1]<br>1. I am considering modifying the English translation first, and after the English modification is completed, I will add translations from other languages. This requires your help, if you are willing (because I am not familiar with other languages). (Good news: Someone is already helping to modify the English translation!)<br>2. Until a reasonable setting is obtained, I will not consider allowing other slugcats to reach NSH temporarily (although you can indeed find that I have done related content when using Warp Menu to reach NSH)<br>3. I'm not sure how many bugs it has now. If you encounter a bug, please let me know. [b]Additionally, without exceptionLog.txt (see Bug Reports), I would hardly be able to do anything about the bugs.[/b]<br><br><br>[h1]Updates: [/h1]<br>[h3][2024.6.5] ver 1.0.8[/h3]<br>1. Updated the English translation text.<br>2. Rewrote the method of reading conversations. Now NSH can support custom conversations for mod slugcats, and if you want to see an example, please check the text folder of The Outsider.<br>[h3][2024.10.27] ver 1.1.0[/h3]<br>1. Added a method to go to NSH for Slugcats after Hunter. (only in story mode now)<br>(Condition: [spoiler]Use Hunter to have Moon repair the aquamarine pearl.[/spoiler] )<br>(Tip: For Slugcats whose OE has not collapsed, [spoiler]use the fixed pearl to pass through the SB-OE gate.[/spoiler] For Slugcats whose OE has collapsed, [spoiler]jump off the cliff.[/spoiler])<br>2. Added behavior and dialogue for NSH when Hunter carries Slugpup.<br>3. Enriched NSH's behavior. For example, the behavior of closing eyes after NSH has been ascended has been added.<br>4. Distinguish neurons for NSH, and add Moon's interpretation of NSH neurons.<br>5. Added NSH's interpretation of Moon's neurons, FP's neurons, FlyLure (Batnip), and SporePlant (Beehive).<br>6. Added the reaction of NSH when players eat neurons in front of NSH.<br>7. Allow adding custom mod Pearl dialogues for NSH.<br>8. Added interpretation of the aquamarine pearl in the timeline of other slugcats for Moon.<br>9. Added NSH response to players throwing Singularity Bomb.<br>10. Some bug fixes.<br>(Attention: Some of the new content is translated into English using machine translation, which may result in biased meanings. Subsequent updates will correct this.)<br>[h3][2024.11.6] ver 1.1.0[/h3]<br>1. Expanded the trigger range for Slugcats whose OE has collapsed [spoiler] to jump off cliffs to NSH[/spoiler].<br>2. Attempt to fix the issue where other slugcat dreams cannot be triggered.<br>[h3][2025.2.14] ver 1.1.1[/h3]<br>1. Added Spanish translation.<br>2. Added custom pearls in the NSH area to the [Collection].<br>3. Some bug fixes.<br>[h3][2025.2.16] ver 1.1.2[/h3]<br>Fixed the issue where Gourmand, Survivor and Monk were unable to [spoiler]use the pearl to open the SB-OE gate when the SB-OE was not opened in Gourmand’s campaign[/spoiler].<br>[h3][2025.4.7] ver 1.1.3[/h3]<br>Support basic game v1.10.1.<br>[h3][2025.4.9] ver 1.1.4[/h3]<br>Fixed the issue in v1.10.1 where the game opening prompt did not take effect.<br>[h3][2025.4.10] ver 1.1.5[/h3]<br>1. Fixed the issue of game freezing when entering a dream mode in multiplayer games.<br>2. Fixed the issue of game freezing and lost save files caused by hibernation after crossing regions. This issue may be related to EmgTx or Warp Menu, and I may not be able to completely fix it in the short term (currently non essential items may be lost in the shelter).<br>[h3][2025.8.21] ver 1.1.7[/h3]<br>1. Fixed conflicts with the 'Chasing Wind' mod. Now [spoiler]the cycle assigned to the hunter by Chasing Wind[/spoiler] will be correctly counted.<br>2. Fixed the issue where the Slugcat of the player lost control in a short period of time due to [spoiler]returning to the previous room after opening the SB-OE gate using the pearl[/spoiler].<br>[h3][2025.8.23] ver 1.1.8[/h3]<br>Modified some of the English translation text. (by OlayColay)<br>[h3][2025.11.1] ver 1.1.9[/h3]<br>Update to adaptive game version 1.11.3.<br>[h3][2025.12.25] ver 1.1.10[/h3]<br>1. Added Russian translation.<br>2. Fixed the issue in The Watcher DLC where players would get stuck [spoiler]when using directional teleportation ability[/spoiler].<br>[h3][2025.12.25] ver 1.1.11[/h3]<br>Using CRS to add NSH's interpretation of pearls now does not require adding '0-' at the beginning of the file name, it can be read according to the usual format of CRS.",

Ever wanted to deliver a neuron fly to Moon within two cycles? Ever wanted to have a quick exterior-shoreline shortcut? Ever felt like the precipice being accessible but having nothing there for slugcats past Artificer and Spearmaster is a bit stupid? Welp! This mod is for you!<br><br>Both bridge01 and edge02 rooms can be jumped from, and the waters below will save your slugcat from death (as long as you don't hit an island by accident... Ouch.)<br><br>ONLY WORKS FOR SLUGCATS WITH SHORELINE, DOES NOT WORK FOR SLUGCATS WITH WATERFRONT FACILITY!<br>What it means: It works for Monk, Survivor, Hunter, Gourmand, and Rivulet.<br>It does not work for Artificer, Spearmaster and Saint.<br><br>Thank you for everyone who helped me make this mod!<br>Make sure to tell me if there are any bugs.<br><br><br>HAVING MERGEFIX ENABLED IS RECOMMENDED<br><br><br>FOR PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE DROP:<br>- I did not make it longer because:<br>a) There was no reason to other than cosmetics, and you look at the drop for such short amount of time that I don't think it matters that much.<br>b) I need to actually spend time in the level editor, slowly and painfully moving across the page (official leditor has very slow movement across the screen, and I don't use community made ones other than the main community editor) and I just did not want to bother with it. I am not going to render any more screens, it is not necessary and would only make it annoying for me to work with for something people likely look at for 0.001 second of their playthrough. I'm really sorry, but no.<br>c) Could lag on weaker computers (unsure of that, but better be safe than sorry)<br>d) I spent whole two hours and likely not more on the mod and I don't think I want to spend more, it was a quick exercise and that is all.<br>- I did not make it require a squidcada because you need to hold one with both hands, and some people might want to use it for stuff such as neuron delivery, or want to use it as a hunter shortcut. Also no squidcadas spawn in precipice, so it is unlikely anyone would bother with dragging one over there just for that.<br><br>Sorry if that makes anyone mad or unhappy, but I will leave it as it is, thank you for understanding.",

I feel its better to separate them from my main pack witch has ocs. Pls color the slugcat with white for the best results. All leg sprites are edited from Miimows Artstyle Legs.<br><br>We all have seen people give their takes on the main slugs, many different cool desings and gimics. But now, I feel the community and their slugs also need some shine! In SAPat Community Slugs you will get playable desings for those slug campains that you love! Hope you enjoy my takes of the characters and dont worry, there are plans on making more skins for other slugies.<br><br>What skins are done in this pack + desing fun facts:<br><br>Gravel eater: From Max's mod, a chonker dragon like slug with a mouth that can destroy any rock, made to do so. Spiky in nature to reflet his endurance.<br>Beacon: From Luzard's mod, the tail sprite is based on a misunderstanding from me in Beacon's menu art, making me think the flashbang plant was her tail, so I added that to the desing.<br>Photomaniac: Also from Luzard's mod, a spiky and bring fella to reflect his ability to explode! Another Fun fact, you can find these same Pitch Black skins in the official mod.<br>Technomancer: From Niko's mod, spiky in similar nature to Photo with a similar premace. Sadly this skin does not look nice with the Techy mod since there are fur sprites that go on top of the DMS :(. Lets hope that gets fixed tho.<br><br>Planned future fellas:<br><br>Escord: The base desing and all other desings that come with their different builds.<br>The Lost: If I remenber correcly that was a centy slug fellow, that will be fun to desing jeje.<br>Incandescent: Funny flame guy<br><br>If yall have any community made slugs that I could do a desing for please leave it down below!

A 'tick' in this case means a single physics step for the game's simulation. While these are often called 'frames', it's important to rememeber these are distinct from graphical frames, so I prefer the term 'tick'.<br><br>In vanilla Rain World, the tickrate is 40 ticks/second, occasionally modified in-game (most commonly by eating a mushroom, being near an Echo, or being in the Depths). Cordyceps allows you to manually cap the tickrate at any value from 1 to 40 Hz. The speedrun/file timer is automatically adjusted to ignore Cordyceps' own slowdown, but still responds normally to vanilla tickrate changes.<br><br>Keybinds for the various functions are configurable in the Remix menu, but are set to the following by default:<br>- Show/hide info panel: [M]<br>- Toggle tickrate cap: [Comma]<br>- Increase tickrate cap: [Equals]<br>- Decrease tickrate cap: [Minus]<br>- Toggle pause: [Period]<br>- Tick advance: [Forward Slash]<br>- Reset tick counter: [Semicolon]<br>- Pause/unpause tick counter: [Single Quote]<br><br>Pressing and holding the increase/decrease tickrate cap keys will make them rapidly change value, so you don't have to repeatedly press them over and over.<br><br>[h2]Note on the Tick Advance Function[/h2]<br>Tick advance can only be used while the game is paused with Cordyceps, and does not work by immediately forcing the next tick to run. Instead, it simply unpauses the game until the next tick occurs, then automatically pauses it again for you. Any inputs you want to occur on the tick you advance to should be held down while you press the tick advance key.<br><br>[h2]OBS Integration[/h2]<br>Cordyceps can, with the help of a companion plugin called Cordyceps-stalk, integrate with OBS and add additional features. Please see the OBS.md file that comes with this mod for more details.<br>",

If downloading from the releases, unzip the ColdSnap.zip file to your Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods folder. <br>[h2]Future Work[/h2]<br>Eventually we would like to make the mod more in line with our original plan for the world we’ve created. Things like replacing the boss that is a custom lizard with a more unique enemy, something more inline with the overarching plot of the game. Part of this would be making the mod more self-contained, and eventually would require fewer dependencies. <br>We would also like to make more visual changes, like more custom animations for steam, melting ice, or a dying fireball. Adding more creatures is a more long term goal, along with having puzzle completion having a greater effect on the world, visibly freezing or melting areas as you progress.<br>[h3]Known Bugs and Issues[/h3]<br>[list]<br>   [*] When loading in rooms there are various Futile image loading errors in the development console<br>   [*] When loading in a fireball there is a Futile atlas warning in logs<br>   [*] A second skinnier orb station may bless your world in puzzle room 3.

He does as he pleases<br>[/list]<br>[h2]Disclaimer[/h2]<br>This mod was created as a team project for a game modding class within The School of Interactive Games and Media (IGM)at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester NY. IGM provides an educational environment that supports and encourages creative and collaborative academic inquiry by both faculty and students. IGM’s programs,  coursework, research, and development efforts provide students with the knowledge and skills to pursue meaningful  and rewarding careers in media-centric, interactive software development, while simultaneously advancing the field and helping to provide a well-rounded educational experience.<br>This mod was made by a team of 5 for a game development modding class. Given the group's timeframe, the mod has not been thoroughly playtested and is currently released as an alpha build. Please report any issues or bugs found to the team, along with any information you can provide about any other mods you’re using, and any actions you took so we are able to replicate it.<br>",

It is quite simple to understand that there is an egg in the den: the indicator of the color of the lizard to which the den belongs will light up. To steal an egg from the den, you need to go to the entrance to it and press the 'Grab' button (or the one that's set in the Remix settings). Restores an egg 1-3 food pips, depending on size; carnivorous slugcats are saturated twice as much. Also, instead of eating the egg, you can save it, and after a few cycles it will hatch into a young lizard who will immediately become your friend. The reputation will decrease when the parent lizard sees its egg in the player's hands.<br>MoreSlugcats and The Watcher not required, but provided. Has a Remix settings.

These creature-influencing features can be disabled though! I would say this makes it suitable as just a cosmetic mod, but you should probably ask around to be sure cuz i'm not qualified to say if it can be used or not. If i recall correctly Improved Input Config is not allowed, and PtM depends on it.<br><br>Q: For some reason, Watcher's special ability doesn't work for me with PtM installed?<br>A: This is most likely a keybind conflict, check settings and rebind the Meow keybind to something else<br><br>Q: The mod is broken after the Watcher DLC released, how do i fix it?<br>A: Someone recently released an updated version of Improved Input Config that fixes these issues, you have to replace the old IIC with this if you still have the old one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3458119961",

These medium sized lizards are just barely light enough to climb poles, which helps them to better reach their favorite diet of invertebrates; but don't be fooled! They will gladly eat an oblivious Slugcat as well.<br>Their bodies produce a fragile projectile that bursts to suffocate their desired prey, allowing them to snipe faster invertebrates before they can flee.<br>Due to this adaptation, it seems that many Centipede species are deathly afraid of them- causing the lizard to act as a natural repellent.<br><br>[h1]Glowzard  ˢᵏᶦⁿᵏ[/h1]<br>They often spend their time camouflaged on ceilings as they let their bright colorful tails dangle down below. The bright glow attracts various critters ranging from Batflies to Leeches, which they then snatch up and eat. It seems there are no limitations to what color a Glowzard may be born with, giving them a wide range of possibilities.<br>However, these glowing tails can also attract unwanted attention from more cannibalistic lizard species; as a result they have adapted to be quite slippery and fast to make up for their naturally frail bodies.<br>Due to their low place in the food chain and their easy to access diet, they make easy tames and companions.<br><br>[h1]Lavender Lizard  ˢᵖᶦᵈᵉʳ ᴸᶦᶻᵃʳᵈ[/h1]<br>Believed to be distantly related to the Caramel Lizard due to their six legs, these lizards are most often found in dark areas infested with Coalescipedes; which they adore to eat. They are notably the only lizard that is naturally venomous, having a similar albeit weaker venom to the Spitter Spider.<br>They are agile and swarming hunters, using their six legs to leap up small distances if they cannot climb, and at times will even form loose packs with other Lavender Lizards much like the Yellow Lizard, though the pack structure is much looser.<br><br>[h1]Mimic Lizard  ᴷᵉˡᵖ ᴸᶦᶻᵃʳᵈ[/h1]<br>These cousins to the Eel Lizard have repurposed their tail fins into a frilly plumage to mimic the carnivorous Pole Plant and Monster Kelp. They appear to share a symbiotic relationship with these plants, often found lurking in environments they would be found in.<br>Due to their poor vision, they are incredibly aggressive and will attack and eat nearly anything they can get ahold of, making them difficult and moody tames.<br><br>[h1]Sea Serpent  ᴺᵃᵍᵃ[/h1]<br>The Sea Serpent is an absolutely massive species of legless lizard that is most often spotted within the depths of Shoreline, though most commonly swarming the Submerged Superstructure. These massive predators are near the top of the food chain, only triumphed by the mighty Leviathan or the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3375001711]Red Aquapede[/url].⁽ᶜᵒᵐᶦⁿᵍ ˢᵒᵒⁿ⁾<br>Their bite is a vice grip, grabbing large creatures such as Vultures into the water to drown and eat, which they often get ahold of after spitting a blast of saliva and water at.<br>It has an incredibly voracious appetite, and as a result makes for one of the most difficult lizard tames.<br><br><br><br>[b]What happened to the full Cloudburst mod?[/b]<br>[i]Due to a combination of other personal projects taking priority, motivation with the Slugbase mod, and lack of modding experience; I have decided to separate Cloudburst into some [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3260747680]character cosmetics[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3260750629]lizards[/url] as their own individual mods.<br>I hope you understand.

"desc": "This mod compiles all the fixes I've made for rainworld and adds any small changes I would like to see in vanilla. This mod should be compatible with all my others!<br><br>Changes:<br>- Creatures that use wormgrassImmune will push wormgrass when they walk through it<br>- All players are visible and can see their light pulse with their breath underwater in jolly coop, instead of just the player that the camera is following (this can occasionally look a little strange, I will tackle this issue when I have the experience to do so)<br>- Spears stuck into monster kelp will rotate with the kelp<br>- Albino and regular leviathans no longer break each other's colors when placed in the same room<br>- The threat theme no longer only tracks player one. Now it plays based on the camera, and will play the highest threat level of the players in the viewed room<br><br>Fixes from my other mods:<br>[downpour fixes]<br>- (Slugpup Safari) Pups can no longer change the colors of players when using auto color<br>- (Slugpup Safari) Pups can no longer snatch items out of your hands while you eat<br>- (Slugpup Safari) Travelling between MS_Heart and MS_Bitterstart no longer deletes pups, items, and tamed lizards<br><br>Will more features be added?<br>- Yes! I plan to add fixes and features to this mod as I think of them! Any future updates will retain the vanilla feel, don't worry!",

This has been a work in progress since 2023, I find the gameplay itself more important than a cutscene you will see once, and I don't care for my own art 99% of the time.

Also has a red boot variation in case you care about silhouette.<br>Rain Hat - replaces the hood with a rain hat instead, putting the hood down. Has a grayscale version.<br>Umbrella Hat - a silly umbrella hat for your slugcat. Has a black/grayscale version.<br>Winter Coat - a cozy winter coat to help Saint endure the blizzard. Has a grayscale version.<br><br><br><br>[MISC] - Random stuff lol<br>Player Eyes - adds a glowing pupil on those void eyes.<br>Player Eyes(white) - same as Player Eyes but white.<br><br><br><br>Fun fact: I tried to make a slugcat mod to add The Avian's campaign and then I stopped working on it after I realized that I have no idea what to do to make what I want, I even had 2 drawn images for it but they are now unused.

Just want to be clear that they're not a required dependency and you don't need them enabled to play Archaic Facility.<br><br>An unassuming floodplain separates an island from a ruined superstructure. On an islet between them, three large holes bore from atop the sand, gaping maws that have consumed countless cycles of dust and rain, flooding into the storied caverns and tunnels of an archaic facility. Mosses grow where spiders creep; not all that glows can be trusted. Will you emerge from the darkness alive?<br><br>As it stands, Archaic Facility features:<br>79 rooms with 208 screens<br>2 subregions<br>2 colored pearls with 8 total dialogue variants<br>3 alternative creature token locations for Bry's Drain Mites and Bubble Weavers<br>A safari token (untested)<br><br>This region was made in mind to provide easy access to Bitter Aerie and to provide more alternative entrances to the Sunlit Trail. To be specific, it connects to Submerged Superstructure, Bitter Aerie, and Moss Fields. As a bonus, I wanted to expand the domains of a lot of fitting modded creatures that live in nearby regions. As a consequence of filling up the region with all that fauna and water, it's quite dangerous.<br><br>Karma gate rooms:<br>Bitter Aerie: [spoiler]MS_bitteraccess[/spoiler]<br>Submerged Superstructure: [spoiler]MS_I11[/spoiler]<br>Moss Fields: [spoiler]MF_C02[/spoiler]<br><br>This first version of Archaic Facility is how it stands between Hunter to Monk's times, and will be polished and improved with player feedback before I dive into different worldstates for the other slugcats (I also need to work on the transition rooms in the other regions) - but different campaigns still have different spawns(except Saint). Check the [url=https://rainworldmods.miraheze.org/wiki/Archaic_Facility]wiki[/url] for more info.<br><br>The region's music was composed by a mysterious benefactor, from whom it is also their first contribution to the Rainworld modding scene! They composed two amazing tracks, one of which has two distinct variations to give each subregion its own distinct feel!<br><br>And the lovely region art and thumbnail were made by yours truly. Obviously if anyone wants to make actual region art I'd be happy to replace it, but I think it's funny and works as is, and it's not like no effort went into it, I'm just not a practiced landscape painter :p<br><br>And for the custom creatures and region connection, credit is due to the following folks for creating the content that inspired me to create Archaic Facility:<br><br>-Myrmice: creating Moss Fields, which had two exclusive creatures now found here as well. Myr's aesthetic was a massive inspiration for the region: In Mossy Grotto, I just thought what if we took Moss Fields' beautiful aesthetic, and made it a dark, underwater, frightening and claustrophobic experience full of spiders instead?<br><br>-Bry: for making three fantastic occupants of the region. The Weavers truly define the region in the later campaigns, and no creature can navigate the Archaic Facility as gracefully and freely as they can. Terrifying stuff, really. And the Drain Mites are adorable.<br><br>cyrille.bernard75: The Polliwogs are a cute yet scary inclusion to the region, and very fitting for a lot of the spaces they occupy. The Noodle Eaters are fantastic for breaking up the tension, those absolute goobers. Water Spitters are hilarious and very fitting lizards. Surface Swimmers make for an awesome aquatic bug fitting the Eggbug niche while suiting the region well. Amazing work here that's already been proven by the regions they already occupy.<br>",

Registering a puptype can be a optional feature if pupbase is installed (an example being the stalker).<br><br>It's great if you want to avoid any issues with incompatibility. Often times what'll happen is you'll have two conflicting variants of pups, both somehow merged into one as its own cursed hybrid, with conflicting stats.

"desc": "READ INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU WANT TO USE THE REMIX MENU!!!<br><br>You know what I always wanted in Saint's campaign? Some ice. But there were no mods on the workshop so I decided I'd try to make it myself. It's not the best thing, but it's my first mod so hopefully y'all won't judge me too hard lol. I spent a good week making this mod, as I started with zero experience. I have so many people to thank, but I'll leave that for the credits section down below. So, I'm sure you're wondering 'What does this mod do exactly?'. Well, it adds a layer of ice to all bodies of water exposed to OPEN SKY. If there's a roof, there will be no ice. I'll list all of the specifics out for you.<br><br>Layers of ice added to:<br>-Frigid Coast/Shoreline (13 rooms! As well as 1 room made easier...)<br>-Glacial Wasteland/Garbage Wastes (7 rooms)<br>-Desolate Fields/Farm Arrays (3 rooms)<br>-Silent Construct (2 rooms)<br>-Icy Monument/Industrial Complex (1 room)<br>-Submerged Superstructure (1 room)<br>(Willing to do more if requested)<br><br>So there you go, that's all there is to it. The 'main attraction' in this mod is Shoreline, and the mod was originally going to just be Shoreline. But I thought, why not give some love to the other places too, right? But if for any reason you don't like a region having the ice, you can remove it! Configuration in modern gaming is just so sweet isn't it?<br><br>Here are the instructions for the Remix Menu. Please follow them CAREFULLY:<br>1) Enable mod and restart.<br>2) Open the remix menu and enable/disable the desired regions then press apply.<br>3) Open the remix menu back up and press and hold the confirm button until fully white (there is no sound).<br>4) Press exit and restart your game.<br><br>Alright, that should be it. I feel like I had a lot more to say when I was making this mod but now I can't think of anything else so I'll just shut up and let you get on with your business lol. Enjoy yourself some Frozen Waters!<br><br>Credit to several people from the Official Rain World Discord Server, as well as the Rain World Modding Discord Server for helping me along the way as I learned what I was doing.<br><br>Remix Menu: Coded by Mills888. Thanks to them for making me a functional Remix Menu, as I have no coding knowledge.<br><br>Ice Prop: Thanks to Solar and his repo for allowing me to use the Coral Caves ice prop (Also thanks to Fishnoid for making Coral Caves and said prop).",

The Development is in progress is subject to change!<br>Me and Bensone have finally decided to migrate this mod to become it's own campaign and will include regions and creatures & our very own slug, dubbed as 'Outpatient', by programming code. Because of this, this mod will require Downpour (and Maybe The Watcher) to function properly! This mod's current state is meant to act as a place-holder and should not be treated as complete!<br><br>Planned Lore: After thousands of years since the fall of the ancient civilization, a strange viral outbreak has plagued Rain World. Not much is known of the origin of this viral disease which causes a biological alternations of infected creatures, causing increased aggression, restlessness, seizures, bigger and stronger appearence and pretty much untamable. The infected region affects the visual appearance, and the whole enviroment is plagued by a mysterious red taint. Infected are bigger and more dangerous.<br><br>Planned features: On-screen camera will have a red tint similar to when hunter becomes sick, but will be much more intense and permanent. Hallucinations. Custom Items. If outpatient becomes bitten by a infected creature, the player will begin to hallucinate and have violent seizures similar to hunter, failure to get treatment results in death. Custom regions. Outpatient by default will have positive reputatation with Scavengers, who will by default be friendly and attempt to follow you around and defend you from threats. Treatment will only be possible by trading with scavengers, so being nice to scavengers is imperative. Successful trading will have a 'Medicine' Scavenger treat and cure the disease.<br><br>Our very own slug, The Outpatient.<br><br><br>Infected Variants are hostile to all creatures and especially other infected<br><br>The following Creatures included are/will be:<br><br>Rack Lizard (Red x Black) <br>Rain Lizard (Red x Train) <br>Reen Lizard (Red x Green) <br>Rue Lizard (Red x Blue) <br>Rhite Lizard (Red x White) <br>Rellow Lizard (Red x Yellow) <br>Ryan Lizard (Red x Cyan) (Credit to Shiny Kelp) <br>Relamander (Red x Salamander) <br>Reramel Lizard (Red x Caramel) <br>Rink Lizard (Red x Pink) <br>Reel Lizard (Red x Eel) <br>Roop Lizard (Red x Strawberry)<br>Rantern Mice (Infected Mouse)<br>Rulture (Infected Vulture)<br>Rong Legs (Infected Rot)<br>Riros (Infected Miros)<br>Reek (Infected Yeek)<br>Roodle (Infected Noodlefly)<br>Ravager (Infected Scavenger)<br>Rail (Infected Snail)<br>Red Spider (Infected Spider)<br>Ratfly (Infected Batfly)<br>Relp (Infected kelp)<br>Role (Infected Pole)<br>Rentipede (Infected Red Centipede)<br>Redcada (Infected Squid)<br>Reviathan (Infected Leviathan)<br>Rup (Infected Slug pup)<br><br><br>PS. Because of the mod's current development, this means it can or will lose it's support of Lizard customizer as we are discussing whether or not should the lizards be made by code, or keep it how it is. We are also currently developing a discord for this and hope to see you soon and support the development of this up-coming mod!<br><br><br>Credits: Slug made by Alga https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198856632963",

The Executioner and The Hermit have mechanics, but no implemented story yet. Their stories will be added in later updates.<br><br>[b]The Sacrifice[/b] is a small and frail semi-biological creature, which resembles an overseer or a neuron. Its playstyle is focused on making use of your mobility (boostjump using jump + grab!) and your ability to chirp(hold grab), which stuns small creatures and attracts attention. You can also starve to switch modes, or hold up + throw at max food pips to starve manually mid cycle.<br><br>[b]The Executioner[/b] is a large and powerful beast, intent on devouring everything in its path. It can create an electric bomb using 1 food pip by swallowing a rock. You can then hold up + grab to turn the bomb into charges for your abilities, your main one being a dash which you can perform by pressing jump + grab.<br><br>[b]The Hermit[/b] is a small slugcat that uses a snail shell as both its weapon and its shield. You can prepare a snail pop by pressing jump + grab.

(although bugs will most likely be present outside of vanilla regions)<br>Also contains support for a handful of mods! (REGION MODS HAVE THE SAME SPAWNS AT NIGHT!) (Should be Compatible with Rain Meadow!)<br><br>REGION CHANGE DETAILS:<br><br>Outskirts: [Spoiler]Outskirts has stayed relatively same with the lack of rain. However at night, alot of creatures found in hunter campaigns appear to hunt.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Industrial Complex: [Spoiler]due to its proximity to shaded, Industrial Complex has found a lot of creatures migrating into the factory halls for the night. With lantern mice, spiders of all sorts and scavengers being notable visitors.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Drainage System: [Spoiler]Drainage system acts as a refuge for all water dwelling creatures that cannot survive in the open ocean. Tardigrades, Barnacles, salamanders and Eels acting as core denizens of the damp tunnels found here. Due to the vast amount of prey available here, some lizards tend to journey here as their hunting grounds.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Chimney Canopy: [Spoiler]Chimney Canopy, that of which is the canopy of the factory halls, has acted as a major cross road for migrating creatures. Lizards venturing towards Sky islands use this as a core path, while water dwellers such as Eels and salamanders may be journeying towards the depths of the gutter in an attempt to reach their hunting grounds. Due to the amount of traffic in this area at night, vultures of all kinds have taken to this region as their own hunting grounds.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Garbage Wastes: [Spoiler]Garbage Wastes at night is a rarity, in which its traffic drops exponentially at night time, with only apex predators being sighted patrolling here during that time. Some scavengers do stay within the trash heaps to look after the check points, with some brave individuals venturing out for pearls. This also applies to past garbage wastes[/Spoiler]<br><br>Shaded Citadel: [Spoiler]Shaded Citadel is a region that is almost unchanged at night. The already pitch black halls only get worse, with some rooms being almost un-traversable without ample lighting. Due to the lack of change here, the ecosystem of the Citadel is practically the same at night, with the main danger being the visibility.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Pipeyard: [Spoiler]Pipeyard acts as a secondary traversal point to go too and from SL and SI. Vultures use this as a hunting ground if they are out competed in CC but for the most part centipedes roam the mines.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Shoreline: [Spoiler]Night Shoreline is another region that is rather empty at night, with only the purely aquatic creatures staying due to the lack of exit points from the remains of this aquifer. Some predators will however take this chance to prey on the smaller creatures here. This also applies to Waterfront facility however due to the extra terrain and places to hide, the amount of predators is significantly higher[/Spoiler]<br><br>Sky Islands: [Spoiler]Sky Islands (due to its altitude and positioning close to farm arrays) has gained a lot of the same traits as LF. Its sun-soaked, humid and acts as a home for sky dwelling creatures during the day. However during the night as the ambient temperature drops, Lizards make the pilgrimage here to use the metallic surfaces as makeshift 'Warming Rocks', making SI an abundant source of lizards of all kinds.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Farm Arrays: [Spoiler]Due to the lack of rain, LF has become much hotter. the ambient temperature and lack of crushing rainfall has caused farm arrays to become lush and overgrown, due to the thick foliage this region attracts all sorts of insects and other prey animals. As a result at night predators will use the cover of darkness to hunt the more than ample food available.[/Spoiler]<br><br>The Exterior: [Spoiler]The Exterior is similar to shaded in its unchanged nature. With traversal of it being the main danger. Rot cysts may drop down from the interior to consume but outside of that, the ecosystem is roughly the same.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Five Pebbles: [Spoiler]This area is unaffected with the rain, and is entirely enclosed and thus unchanged.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Subterranean: [Spoiler]The depths of these caves is another traversal point, but as a whole acts as a refuge for blind or naturally night dwelling creatures. With it consisting primarily of black lizards, centipedes and monster kelp. Filtration System at night has become a dwelling for orange lizards, that of which out compete day times black lizards and feed on the smaller creatures that wonder into the pipes below.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Outer Expanse: [Spoiler]Outer Expanse is a region that is roughly unchanged from its rainy counterpart. This is due to the majority of the region already being free from the rain. Sunken pier has taken on a lot of the ecosystem that's present in the rest of the region.[/Spoiler]<br><br>Submerged Superstructure: [Spoiler]This regions main changes are found in Bitter Aerie, with the ecosystem being roughly the same due to the hard to reach nature of the sub region. The rest of this region however is enclosed and not exposed to sunlight, as a result the creatures that dwell here have stayed roughly the same.[/Spoiler]<br><br>NMRW needs to be at the TOP of the load order! I cannot guarantee compatibility for mods outside of the list below. LOAD ORDER CHANGES WILL TAKE LONGER TO GO THROUGH WITH NMRW! Its a HUGE amount of files to merge!<br><br>MOD SUPPORT BELOW!!

"desc": "[img]https://rwmoddingch.github.io/ChModdingWiki/assets/WorkShop/Title.png[/img]<br>[h3]/About RandomBuff/[/h3]<br>RandomBuff is a mod that aims to enrich the gameplay experience by adding some Roguelike mechanics. Players will be able to draw cards at the end of each cycle, which will have an interesting influence on the game's gameplay and mechanics. During play, players will be able to complete missions to gain experience and increase their level in order to unlock special cards and cosmetics. [b]Compatible with Watcher DLC[/b]<br><br>[h3]/Card System/[/h3]<br>The core mechanic of RandomBuff is 'cards'. Each card can be thought of as a separate mod or game modifier, and once a card is drawn into a player's buff slot, it will be enabled and have an interesting effect on the gameplay. <br>[img]https://rwmoddingch.github.io/ChModdingWiki/assets/WorkShop/Mutation.gif[/img]<br>Usually the player will do two draws at the end of each cycle. In each draw, three cards will be drawn and presented to the player and the player will be allowed to choose one (or two, if this card is in a stack with another card). The first from the 'Positive' and 'Duality' categories, and the second from the 'Duality' and 'Negative' categories. Players can also acquire cards through free draws or cards that come with the Mission Mode. In Free Mode, if a player has a passage, they can remove a card from the buff slot and make it inactive.<br><br>[h3]/Missions，Levels and Cosmetics/[/h3]<br>Players can choose either Free Mode or Mission Mode at the beginning of the game. In Free Mode, players can select 1-5 tasks to start the game or 0 tasks to start Endless Mode. In Mission Mode, players can start the game with some specified cards and missions. <br><br>In both Free Mode and Mission Mode, returning to the Shelter after completing all missions will trigger a checkout, which will give you experience and increase your level based on the game's stats, as well as unlock free card draws, special cards, and cosmetics. cosmetics can add interesting visual effects to your slugcat, but do not provide any special advantages or enhancements.<br>[img]https://rwmoddingch.github.io/ChModdingWiki/assets/WorkShop/Cosm.gif[/img]<br>[b]Special reminder:[/b]<br>-This mod works fine in coop mode.<br>-This mod is compatible with most other community mods, but we still recommend avoiding enabling too many non-essential mods at the same time to minimize lag or crashes.

"desc": "Randomizes the connections between regions, redirecting karma gates to load different regions. Now features better region placement logic and far greater stability!<br><br>UPDATE 1.2.5: Added compatibility with Rain Meadow!!<br>* However, after passing through a gate, DO NOT RE-ENTER THE GATE ROOM (unless absolutely all players have exited). Passing through a gate, exiting it, and then re-entering it (on the same cycle) will crash your game.<br>* Also improved region placement logic significantly.<br>UPDATE 1.2 (Huge update!):<br>* Regions are now arranged by default in such a way that navigating the world has some sense. Try to make a map as you go along of where each region is!<br>* Karma gates no longer forcibly teleport all creatures outside of the gate upon passing through them. Instead, gates should be passable in a fairly normal fashion.<br>    -NOTE: Some gates have hidden connections. Use dev tools (O + M) or the map if you cannot find the exit.<br>* Significant stability and performance improvements. While you might not directly notice all of them, the overall effect should be quite noticeable.<br>* Added the option to keep karma gate requirements unchanged.<br>* Added support for custom regions with 3-letter acronyms.<br><br>I made this mod because I have a problematic playstyle: I rush straight to the nearest functioning iterator and then bee-line towards the Depths. I wanted to explore community-made regions, but most of them are out of the way of normal campaigns. Therefore, I wrote a mod to scramble regions around so I would have to wander around dozens of regions searching for an iterator.<br>This mod makes you go on a hunt for echoes in order to gain 10 (X) karma (or as much karma as is possible) in order to go to an iterator and receive the Mark of communication, which is required to access Subterranean. You may even find yourself exploring Metropolis as Rivulet, or passing through the Exterior and the Rot as Saint!<br><br>Settings explanation:<br>* Gate Karma Penalty: Subtracts from the player's karma when passing through gates, as an extra challenge. I added this because it was too easy to sprint from one region to the next, spending little time in each region.<br>* Karma Per Echo: Recommended to be kept at -1, so that it is automatically generated.<br>* Random Karma Leniency: Makes some karma requirements randomly more lenient.<br>* Regions tab: This enables settings for each region, specifically the ability to make the randomizer ignore a region or to make it forbid entry into that region entirely.<br>The other settings should not be touched, since most are either dysfunctional or potentially game-breaking.<br><br>KNOWN ISSUES:<br>* Upon first starting a campaign/expedition, the gate karma requirements will likely not yet be updated. Use a shelter at least once before passing through any gate.<br>* Having the map open while passing through the gate can create bugs. Just don't open it while using a gate.<br>* The game occasionally freezes upon using the first karma gate. Reload the game and try again.<br>* Custom slugcat campaigns are mostly untested; use at your own risk.<br>* Monk can unlock gates that were never supposed to be unlocked. This is unfortunately unavoidable. Just don't use Monk, coward.<br>* Some custom regions may not work well with the randomizer. If you experience issues with any gates, try using devtools to see the name of the gate before and after you activate it. This will help me troubleshoot.<br>* Several gates have their karma symbols flipped, causing some regions to be erroneously (in)accessable. There is little I can do about the incompetence of other mod authors.",

[/h1]<br><br>This modpack for the lizard customizator revamps the base lizards of the game, Taking inspiration from speculative evotion! With this mod, you will see:<br><br>[h2] Green Lizards: the robust executioner. [/h2]<br><br>Pushed to the brink by the relentless aggression of the ecosystem, the green lizards have evolved to kept pushing their grow. The biggest and strongest survived, getting better not only at taking damage, but also dealing it.<br><br>Being now the largest and heaviest lizard in these lands, they maximized their bulk and armor, getting to the point of withstanding immense damage without much issue. Having jaws that can shatter bone, one well-placed bite can suprass even the mighty red lizard's one. This new power doesn't come without any cost, as this giants have to eat a lot to sustain their new bodies, even eating other lizards now. This drove them not only to learn to slowly climb walls in order to travel to lands with more food, but also to dive in deep waters to travel catch prey.<br><br>Miros birds, vultures, plants and even the rot tend to avoid this behemoth, aware of the trouble that takes to kill and eat just one. Most of their fights are now intraspecific, shaking the ground as they push and bite each other.<br><br>Weight: 15.<br>Bite damage: 8.<br>Damage chance: 100%<br>Toughness: Both 25.<br><br>[h2] Maned Green Lizards: Invasive new age. [/h2]<br><br>In a world where survival often demands adaptability, the Maned Green Lizard emerged as a distinct subspecies from a population of Green Lizards that did not achieve the same colossal size. As the bigger population bulked up, these lizards developed a more agile build, allowing them to carve out a niche with their bare claws.<br><br>This worked out very well, as the consistent success of this population made it grow in great numbers. The uncontrolled growth sparkled the competition heavily, as new adaptations started to surge; Great manes started to emerge around their necks, alongside new unique patterns, in order to display good health and genes. Armored faces, with spiky horn-like armor evolved alongisde new, never seen of level of agression.<br><br>But with this mix of speed and agression, maned lizards slowly started to expand to new lands. New prey resulted in less competition, and less competition leads to... collaboration. This kind of lizards prefer to focus entirely on their prey, not attacking eachother. To this day, intraspecific fights are weird in maned lizards, and their presence is starting to become more notable. While not as big as greens, maned lizards still manage to dwarf even caramels and to kill most things to saciate their quick metabolisms.<br><br>Only time will tell if the native fauna can cope with it. After all, after every massive extinction a new age begins.<br><br>Weight: 8.6<br>Bite damage: 6<br>Damage chance: 100%<br>Toughness: 20<br>Stun toughness: Similar to red lizards.<br><br>[h2] Blue Lizards: lesser, but better. [/h2]<br><br>Sharing a common ancestry with Cyan Lizards, the Blue Lizards have evolved along a parallel path, developing the same jumping abilities and a familiar pattern that nearly earns them the title of 'lesser cyans.'<br><br>However, the Blue Lizards possess unique advantages that set them apart. Their widespread presence across various regions has given them a solid foothold in the ecosystem, getting most of the time to places where cyans didn't.<br><br>However, what truly makes them formidable, is their newfound social behavior; they no longer attack each other. Instead, Blue Lizards collaborate, working together to corner their prey. Combined with their long jumps, this pack mentality transforms them into a highly efficient and dangerous force, capable of taking down even the most elusive targets.<br><br>[h2] Pink and Black Lizards: Rivalry. [/h2]<br><br>As the shadow citadel became more and more fierce, lots of black lizards starting to move to the surface in order to survive. A world that only became harsher was waiting above, and they would have to adapt or go extinct. <br><br>It wasn't easy, as time blessed generalist animals such as wolf spiders and... Pink lizards, whose have learned to even climb walls independently of their linage. They adapted to move wherever the conditions are suitable, becoming way more resilient that a lot of their pink ancestor to the enviroments.<br><br>Black lizards, luckily, didn't sucumb to the pressure of the ecosystem. As generations passed, their hide got thicker and more loose, allowing them to turn quickly in order to bite anything that comes close. Their bite force grew alongside them, in the same way that their pattern recognition in order to survive. <br><br>It is only the beginning of yet another evolutionary race to remain. <br><br>[h2] Caramel Lizards: Subtle changes. [/h2]<br><br>As caramel lizards lost their once curious 'third pair of legs'—appendages with no clear function—, they did not change a whole lot. Without those appendages bothering it's way of moving, they can now climb poles, making them the only member of the green lizard family that is able to do so.<br><br>[h2] Eels and Yellow Lizards: Convergence. [/h2]<br><br>As times got tougher, some lizards solutioned similar problems with similar solutions. Eel lizards, getting suprisingly outcompeted by salamaders, started to hunt in packs to get more chances of surviving and catching prey. As time went on, eel lizars developed a pair of antenna, in a very similar manner to yellow lizards.<br><br>And speaking of which, yellow lizards didn't lag behind, as they got faster run rates and the capacity of using their tongue to hunt, slowing down prey while other yellows sprint to maul their new prey. The competition with cyan lizards was harsh enough already, so now having their smaller relatives competing for their niche too pushed yellows into the same agression spiral as other species. There may be some more agressive specimens lurking around, slowly waiting to take over the top of the foodchain.<br><br>In any case, the reds, whites and strawberry lizards still didn't change even with the great pass of time, as they're adapted enough to survive in this world. But no world refuses to change, and most probably, these lizards won't refuse to change in the future. Who knows what the future will hold for this scaled creatures?

"desc": "[h3]TLDR:[/h3]<br>This mod provides useful intelligence about the scavengers, like the number of [u]scavenger kills you have[/u] and the [u]total number of scavengers in the region[/u], updated accordingly. In addition, it [u]points you toward the best scavenger target within the room[/u], as well as [u]providing a power level for all scavengers[/u], with a configurable keybind to toggle it on/off.<br><br>This mod is specifically designed for Artificer & friends who strive to exterminate the whole scavenger population in a region, without getting killed unfairly. <br><br>For those new to Scavenger extermination and combat, the mod’s utility may not be obvious at first. I encourage you to read along, but beware of heavy spoilers regarding Scavenger AI design, combat logic and many technical knowledge of the game!<br><br><br>[h3]Detailed description:[/h3]<br>This mod does 7 things:<br>[olist]<br>[*]Displays the number of scavenger kills you have obtained in this cycle.<br>[*]Displays the number of maximum attainable scavenger kills at the current moment.<br>[*]Displays the total number of scavengers that spawned in this cycle.<br>[*]Displays the countdown until a scavenger kill / protect squad can potentially spawn near<br>you. (though you will probably only encounter kill squads lol)<br>[*]Displays the number of scavengers in the squad if the squad is active.<br>[*]Displays the most desirable target scavenger to destroy in the room, if there is one<br>available, as an arrow next to your Slugcat.<br>[*]Displays a level for every scavenger, such that higher levels ones have better combat skill<br>stats.<br>[/olist]<br><br>I encourage you read the wiki on scavengerAI, as well as the technical pages for<br>scavenger combat skills if these concepts are confusing.<br><br>Items 1 - 5 can be viewed during gameplay and the hibernation screen by pressing the map button. Specifically, you can use the ratio of item 1 and item 2 to determine how safe you are from a surprise scavenger attack, while the ratio of item 1 and item 3 shows you how close you are to clear the region. Items 1 - 3 are arranged as three numbers next to each other like “(1/2/3)” when you press the map. Note that for item 5, not all scavenger spawns in the world are classified as kill squads. There are small inconsistencies in this number, but it should roughly do its job.<br><br>Item 7 can be toggled on / off with a button of your choice. The color of the arrow and the levels interpolates from white to red to indicate how high the level is. The formula for the level is the weighted average between the five combat skills of the scavenger, multiplied by 100, with a heavier weight applied toward the reactionSkill. Use these numbers to choose from a more conservative / aggressive attack plan. <br><br>All items can also be turned off in the Remix menu!<br><br>[h3]FAQ:[/h3]<br>Q: What is the difference between item 2 and item 3?<br>A: Item 2 decreases when a scavenger retreats or dies for a non-player cause, while item 3 does not.<br><br>Q: What mods are compatible with this?<br>A: Known compatibilities: SBCameraScroll, HealthBar, JollyCoop, DevConsole, WarpMenu (mostly).<br><br>Q: How does item 6 calculate the best scavenger to point?<br>A: It points to the nearest scavenger to you, but if a scavenger is also able to hit you, the pointer is more preferential toward it compared to another scavenger on the other side of a wall.<br><br>Q: My game crashed!<br>A: Sorry about that! Contact Nacu in the RW discord to report the bug. Send the exceptionLog as well.<br><br>Q: Why do you hate the scavengers sooo much :(<br>A: Scavs are an incredible feat for RainWorld’s developers. Fighting them feels like fighting real players in an online game, and it feels awesome to play the game at its full potential.<br><br>[h3]Credits:[/h3]<br>[list]<br>[*]Author: Nacu (@smalltowniak on discord)<br>[*]Commissioned & Tested by: 雨世界实验室 (@rwlab4594 on discord)<br>[/list]<br><br>Github link: https://github.com/Nacu0021/ScavIntel",

"desc": "A mod that balances the Downpour slugcats to be less OP whilst adding some fun new mechanics to keep things fun. ALL of these changes can be totally disabled in the mods's config menu (or modified to your liking). Since its initial release, this mod has grown to encompass many ideas for slugcat nerfs, several of which you may dislike. That's fine! Disable or tweak them to your liking!<br>Ever felt like Gourmand creating life was a little unrealistic? Or Artificer is totally over-powered and not fun? Or Rivulet gets too easy after taking the Cell? Or Saint's tongue shouldn't launch you so high? Well, this mod fixes all of that!<br><br>UPDATE 1.1.0: Rain Meadow compatibility!<br>Not that Meadow compatibility matters too much. Really, all this does is prevent you from using this mod as a 'cheat.'<br>Yeah, sorry, no more cheating.<br><br>Gourmand:<br>* Gourmand moves 10% faster when on an empty stomach (but gets exhausted 10% more quickly) (configurable).<br>* Crafting Nerfs: Gourmand can no longer create life or void-powered explosives.<br>* Gourmand's slide speed is reduced slightly (0.8x) (configurable in the config menu).<br>* Gourmand's spears deal 0.8x damage than usual. You can alter this number to your pleasure in the config menu.<br>* Gourmand becomes exhausted 10% faster when at 0 food pips, lessening as Gourmand consumes more food. (Additionally, Gourmand's overall rate of exhaustion can be configured, but is unchanged by default.)<br>(Gourmand has minimal changes that don't affect his gameplay much, except it'll be harder to kill the red centipede.)<br><br>Artificer:<br>* Movement speed is slightly reduced (0.9x) (configurable).<br>* Scavenger population is 50-60% of what it previously was, making things easier. (Alternatively, you can increase the population).<br>* Crafting explosives now costs twice as much food (but only requires 1 pip).<br>* Artificer's explosion jumps are less powerful (0.8x), restraining mobility slightly. Or you can increase the explosion power...<br>* Explosion jumps and parries reduce your food by a quarter-pip (configurable) (optionally can make this required to explosion jump).<br>* Parries now count as two explosion jumps towards the explosion counter.<br>* Being stunned by explosions causes Artificer to overheat (configurable).<br>* Scavengers are worth half as much food in Artificer's campaign (only 2 pips) (configurable). This encourages the player to find other food sources.<br>* Artificer's spear throws can now be angled up to 25 degrees (configurable)! Now you can stab scavs slightly above or below you!<br>* (Artificer's throwing ability can be optionally configured.)<br>* Artificer's spear throws are significantly slower in arena mode only (configurable).<br>* For quality-of-life, Artificer's second ending can be obtained after the first one on the same save file now (configurable). (Note: Works by resetting all echo progress upon achieving the first ending (so echoes can be revisited). Makes visiting echoes still grant karma.)<br>(Artificer's absurdity was what prompted this mod to be made. I reduced her powers but also her threats (scavs), and gave her the unique ability to fight back against scavs better by angling spear throws.)<br><br>Rivulet:<br>* Rivulet's land movement speed is decreased (0.8x) (configurable).<br>* Rivulet's spear throwing ability and damage is reduced to be identical to Monk's.<br>* Rivulet's slide speed is slightly decreased (0.8x) (configurable).<br>* Rivulet's jump height is significantly decreased (0.8x) (or you can increase it in the config menu).<br>* (Rivulet Spoilers:) Taking 5P's Cell no longer extends cycles (by default, taking the Cell doubles or triples cycle length). Instead, it makes precycles much more common, but precycle rain is less dangerous.<br>* Rot walls will not pull in Rivulet as hard, making escape more likely.<br>(Rivulet just needed minor decreases in movement. However, taking the Cell made gameplay easy in the base campaign. Now you'll have to use its power to rush through the light rain.)<br><br>Spearmaster:<br>* Spearmaster's movement speed has been slightly decreased (0.9x) (configurable).<br>* Takes a quarter-pip of food away for every second spear produced (configurable).<br>* Growing a spear without any food causes Spearmaster to have Gourmand's exhaustion for a few seconds (configurable).<br>* Repeatedly throwing spears (and/or growing them with food) can briefly trigger Gourmand's exhaustion mechanic for a second or two (configurable).<br>* Increased the chance of dying instantly to a lizard bite by 50% (configurable).<br>* Increased Spearmaster's jump height by ~10% (configurable) to make platforming sections slightly easier and to compensate for the 10% speed decrease.<br>* Spearmaster's produced needles now only deal 80% of their former damage (1 damage when thrown by Spearmaster). This makes normal spears still valuable.<br>* (Spearmaster's throwing ability can be optionally configured.)<br>* (The rate at which Spearmaster grows spears can be optionally configured, but is unchanged by default.)<br>(Spearmaster didn't really need any gameplay balancing. The eighth-pip cost is insignificant unless you tend to spam spears, and the exhaustion mechanics are just a fun gimmick to make spamming spear throws slightly harder.)<br><br>Saint:<br>* Saint's tongue produces less upward velocity when being retracted (configurable). This makes Saint's tongue function more like a Grapple Worm.<br>* Saint's tongue is now shorter (80% of previous length).<br>* Saint cannot lean to the side as far while hanging down from the ceiling.<br>* Saint's swinging speed (when grappling using his tongue) is increased by 50%.<br>* Saint's tongue can now be aimed precisely using a controller stick.<br>* Lanterns swallowed by Saint provide much less heat (0.6x) (configurable). Now it's much better to hold them.<br>* The amount of heat provided by external objects is very slightly reduced (0.9x).<br>* (The rate at which Saint's temperature changes can be optionally configured.)<br>* Saint's 'God Timer' is slightly reduced (configurable). Its recharge rate is optionally configurable.<br>(Saint could basically fly by spamming the jump button. Now his tongue simply functions as an OP Grapple Worm instead of a mode of sustainable flight. Additionally, hoarding 2 lanterns made the hypothermia mechanics irrelevant, so lanterns are now less potent.)<br><br>If there is anything else that annoys you about the Downpour slugcats that you want balanced, make a suggestion; maybe I'll make the change for you. If your suggestion is based how over-powered the slugcat is in arena mode, mention that in your suggestion.<br>And if you complain that my settings aren't severe enough... click on the 'Extreme Settings' preset.",

"desc": "Adds a ton of new lizards and centipedes. (reuploaded due to crashing)<br><br>Natural spawns added, no need for simple spawn swapper!<br><br>Black Centipede: Blind, like black lizards and are allied with them too. About as big as a red centipede. They can be found in all regions black lizards are found in, and in outer expanse at night<br><br>Blue Centipede: Medium to big sized centipedes, they are the most territorial of any centipede, they will even kill other members of their species. They are widespread but hibernate during rivulet because of the heavy rain. During saint their population explodes.<br><br>Cyan Centipede: A big centipede that is able to fly without wings though it mostly likes to walk instead. it eats some other species of centipedes including other cyan centipedes. Only found in the very early campaigns though can be lineaged.<br><br>Grey Centipede: Aggresive long legged centipede with a lethal shock. They are found in every campaign in almost every region.<br><br>Elder Centiwing: Giant centiwings that are slightly more aggresive to slugcat. Spawns coming later!<br><br>Pink Centipedes: Medium sized fast centipede. They are kinda boring(like pink lizards), although they are very aggresive. They are widespread and can be lineaged into red centis among other centis.<br><br>White Centipedes: Giant neutral centipedes that have a curious nature. Look but dont touch... Found across the map in pairs of 2, Sadly spearmaster ate one of them in waterfront facility and is the reason why arti only finds 1 in her campaign.<br><br>Gigantopede: Long centipede...thankfully doesnt spawn in story mode<br><br>Baby Lizard: Unlike other species of lizards, these lizards live entirely inside of their mother, though once isolated from them will walk around without any fear of predators<br><br>Mother Lizard: Female versions of green lizards, these lizards can climb, unlike green lizards, and are smaller in size. If they are approached by what they think is a predator, they will spit out a Baby lizard, hoping that the predator eats the baby lizard instead. They only spawn at outskirts because its a breeding ground for green lizards.<br><br>Baby iguana: Baby versions of iguana lizards. They dont spawn.<br><br>Iguana lizards,: Intelligent species of lizards that have many enemies, including spards and yellow lizards. They are neutral to slugcat and instead spend their days protecting baby iguanas. They also have 360 vision, like Spards. They are found in Subterrenean and Outer Expanse, can be lineaged into King Lizards. They also migrated to Undergrowth during saints campaign.<br><br>Brickstone Lizard: Extremely rare species of lizard, they have giant yellow eyes unlike the rest of the lizard family. Only found in Sky islands, where they live in colonies<br><br>Cat Lizard: A species of slugcat that has evolved to look like lizards to avoid predators. They are also one of the rarest types, to find one you must kill the infant centipede that spawns in OE_RUIN17, whom will reincarnate as a catlizard next cycle. Eating the centipede will make the cat lizard no longer spawn.<br><br>King Lizard: A beefy and tanky lizard with a crown to show the other peasant lizards who the true king of the (rain) world is. They can take many spears to the face(literally) before giving up. Unlike other lizards, they do not have shielded faces. They are found in farm arrays and outskirts, but can lineaged by killing Iguanas<br><br>Mimic lizard: A big lizard that has evolved to look like blue lizard to trick them into thinking they are an ally. Green lizards may also attempt to eat them...but fail. They are found in many regions, usually alone<br><br>Spard: A cross between a spider and lizard, they share both abilities, with the powerful bite of a lizard and the many legs of a spider, they pose a significant threat to slugcat. Avoid them if possible, as they share many symbiotic relationships with other lizards and spiders that they may use to their advantage. They also hate iguana lizards for some reason. They can be found in many regions though only appear during night. Their main home is shaded citadel<br><br>Tiny lizard: A tiny lizard species with the ability to glow in the dark, slugcat may use this to their advantage in the shaded citadel, as they are swallowable and grabbable. Though catching one may be hard, making them stay in your hand is even harder. They are common prey to other lizards. They spawn in very few dark regions.<br><br>BTW Frogs v2 has been cancelled and instead merged with 100 creatures incase anyone was wondering!",

"desc": "IMPORTANT!!!: This mod will most likely have the same flickering problem the More Wingcat wings mod has.INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX DA FLICKERING:Step 1: go to files > Steam > steamapps > worshop > content > 312520.Step 2: search the number 3021911328 in the top right search bar. (the number for the wingcat mod.) I recommend pinning it to your taskbar to make it easier to find again.Step 3: find the disassembly drone wings mod and replace the original wings (most likely just search disassembly drone wings in 312520.) ((also recommend to pin to taskbar.))Step 4: Toggle the same wings in DMS.Extra things to know:- the wings are only on layer 1-The wings are poorly made lol-This mod is to go with the MD skins made by kaija.Might upload Uzi's Solver wings as well!",

(More Slugcats Expansion is extremely recommended)<br><br>NOTE: THIS ITEM DOES NOT SPAWN NATURALLY! If you want to be able to obtain swords in your playthrough, use the spawn settings in the config menu for this mod, or spawn it in sandbox, or use the Sword expedition perk.<br><br>(Update 1.0.7: Rain Meadow support + minor hitbox improvements + support for multiple sword retextures)<br><br>If you couldn't guess by now, this is a bit of a joke mod; but that didn't stop me from wanting to make it decent quality. The sword is an absurdly effective weapon against any creature, but it's not unbeatable. Have fun slicing up every creature in sight, though!<br><br>Sword Mechanics:<br>* Press throw to attack using the sword (this technically throws the sword, holds it in front of your slugcat, then returns it to your hand if it is still empty).<br>* Swinging the sword in mid-air will give you a boost in the direction of your swing, allowing for some fun movement.<br>* Swords can deflect thrown weapons and parry other swords, allowing for some PvP combat.<br>* Dual-wielding is not intended, but it's funny. Dual-wielding swords can be disabled in the config menu.<br>* Using the sword factors in your input directions:<br>    - Swinging upward will flip many creatures over.<br>    - Slicing downward will stun creatures for much longer.<br>    - Stabbing forward has the longest reach and transfers your momentum.<br>* Most arbitrary numbers in my code are modifiable in the config menu, so feel free to modify them to your liking.<br><br>PVP + EXTRAS:<br>* Increase the parry window so players will have more time to react in a fight (but don't make it more than half the swing time).<br>* Decrease the damage and stun modifiers, so that one hit with a sword isn't instant-death.<br>* Increasing the pushback amounts will improve the feel of combat, since it's harder to run straight through someone's defense.<br>* Enabling stamina mechanics discourages button mashing by causing swings to become weaker, shorter, and more parry-able if used repeatedly; and consecutive swings can even cause exhaustion (like Gourmand).<br>    -(Note: Slugcats' in-game stamina meter is increased by actions such as running and especially jumping, so it's possible to become exhausted after only 1 swing if the slugcat is already tired.)<br>* Enabling omnidirectional swings and vertical pushback > 1.5 allow for Hollow-Knight-style pogos and vertical attacks.<br><br>Check out kitsu ||'s Nail Mod texture + sound effects!<br>If any modder wants to use this item for anything, it's ID is 'SwordMod_Sword'.<br><br>KNOWN ISSUES:<br>* The sword frequently doesn't appear in shelters when first loading a save. This can be fixed by immediately exiting to menu and re-entering that slugcat's save.",

Just give the game a moment to let creatures exit their dens first to avoid this! If it happens, just return to the main menu and reload the save.[/i]<br>[b]- Watcher creatures may not respond or softlock the game on Safari Mode.[/b]<br>[I]This is because The Watcher DLC does not have official Safari Mode support. Most creatures will simply ignore player input, but some such as Rot Lizards will freeze the game until control is revoked.[/i]<br>[b]- Loaches may 'freeze' the room if killed by a Monster Kelp or Leviathan.[/b]<br>[i]This is not a true freeze and you can still move through the room, though visual effects, weapons, and creatures might appear frozen. Refreshing the room fixes it entirely.[/i]<br>[b]- Loaches are a little silly and try to eat Leeches despite not being able to eat them.[/b]<br>[i]They're just silly chubby guys.[/i]<br><br><br><br>[h2]Mod Incompatabilities:[/h2]<br>[b]- Mods that add extra rot to GW_E01 will crash the game.[/b]<br>[i]This is because the game cannot handle Rattlers dying to Protolonglegs. Disable any mods that may cause these changes if the issue occurs.[/i]<br>[b]- Mods that affect Barnacles may crash the game.[/b]<br>[i]The most common cause for this is Emerald's Tweaks, however other mods can cause this issue too- most often if they touch the shell breaking code. Disable any mods that may cause these changes if the issue occurs or use Keep That Away From Me to blacklist them until those mods are fixed.[/i]<br>[b]- Mods that edit rooms may conflict with the mod.[/b]<br>[i]The issues here are minimal, but it may result in missing Foods/Mudpits/Music/Creatures depending on which room it is, as some are placed through map spawners rather than dens. But this shouldn't cause any crashes. Just know that this mod edits A LOT of rooms, especially in places like Sky Islands or Outer Expanse.[/i]<br><br><br><br>[h1][b][u]LIKE WITH ANY WORLD EDITING MOD, I RECOMMEND STARTING A NEW CAMPAIGN FOR MOST OF THE CHANGES TO APPLY.[/u][/b][/h1]<br>Newly added creature spawns may not appear on older save files. If you are noticing this problem, it is recommended to restart the campaign. Alternatively, reset your region spawns through Devtools or a Setup file.<br><br>[h3]If you enjoy the mod, remember to rate it up! It helps a lot![/h3]",

"desc": "[hr][/hr]<br>[h1]What is it[/h1]<br>Rain Meadow is a true online multiplayer engine for Rain World! It includes both Story and Arena gamemodes, as well as a new 'Meadow' gamemode based on the titular game 'Meadow' by Might and Delight. Simply enable the mod, and click the new 'Meadow' button on the game's title screen to get started. Matchmaking is handled through Steam automatically with no additional setup required. Connections through LAN are also possible for those that own Rain World on GOG.<br><br>[hr][/hr]<br>[h2]Compatibility[/h2]<br>[list]<br>  [*]Meadow works on Windows, and Linux/MacOS through Wine/Proton, though for Wine/Proton you'll need to use the following launch argument: [code]WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winhttp=n,b' %command%[/code]<br>  [*]For the best possible experience, [b]disable all non-essential mods.[/b] If you're experiencing crashes, desyncs, or similar issues, try trimming your mod list down to the absolute necessities. Even some theoretically client-side or meadow-compatible mods may cause problems.<br>  [*]Anyone connecting to a host using 'content' mods (that add regions, campaigns, objects, gameplay mechanics, etc) must use the same list of content mods, in the same order. Meadow has a mod-syncing tool that will prompt you to enable/disable/reorder mismatched mods when joining a lobby, but its detection isn't perfect.<br>  [*]Remix, More Slugcats, and Watcher are considered content mods, though their load order in particular doesn't matter. Dev Tools and Jolly Coop both work client-side; Jolly lets you connect multiple scugs to a Meadow lobby from a single instance of Rain World. Expedition doesn't conflict with Meadow, but currently does [i]not[/i] integrate in any way. All other mods may or may not work depending on how they are implemented; for a baseline you can check [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QG1xYPLECkVSMc2vopO-Rw2rSdnn7_fsdlMajhAUOW0/edit?gid=0#gid=0]this community-maintained compatibility spreadsheet.[/url]<br>[/list]<br><br>[hr][/hr]<br>[h2]Game Modes[/h2]<br><br>[h3]Meadow[/h3]<br>[list]<br>  [*]Explore a peaceful version of Rain World, free from rain or predators! Encounter other players, roam together gathering tokens to unlock new emotes, skins and even other creatures to play as.<br>  [*]Communicate with gestures, vocalizations, and a full set of custom emotes for each creature, designed by @Wolfycat!<br>  [*]Features an hour-long original soundtrack by @Intikus!<br>  [*]Playable creatures' controls and navigation have been completely rebuilt to offer a smoother experience than Safari mode.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h3]Story[/h3]<br>[list]<br>  [*]Uses its own set of save slots, so it won't mess with your regular story saves.<br>  [*]All vanilla campaigns are available by default, and all DLC campaigns are available with their respective DLCs enabled. Other campaigns can be accessed through the 'Experimental Features' option in Meadow's remix settings.<br>  [*]The Survivor, Monk, Hunter, and Gourmand campaigns are all fully supported and should be stable. All other Downpour campaigns should mostly work, but you may run into quirks or the occasional desync. Most of Watcher is playable but [b][i]not[/i][/b] yet very stable; expect bugs. Any other campaigns are not explicitly supported and will likely desync or crash on any 'special events'.<br>  [*]All players can play as any slugcat, though the host has an option to restrict everyone to the current campaign's slugcat. The host can also restart the cycle at any time from the pause menu.<br>  [*]Piggybacking is supported; jump next to a player's head and hold exclusively grab to climb onto their back. The piggybacker can press jump to dismount, or the piggybackee can drop them like an item.<br>  [*]Food is shared between all players, and stomach size is based on the selected campaign. Diet and food nourishment are determined by each individual player's selected slugcat. For instance, playing on the Gourmand campaign will always use a 7|4 food bar, and playing as Hunter will always let [i]your[/i] slugcat eat meat, but only get 1/4th pip from danglefruit.<br>  [*]All players must either be unmoving in shelter(s), or dead for shelters to close. All players, dead or alive, must be physically present and unmoving at a karma gate for it to activate. In either case, players can exit to the character select to avoid being considered, and let others progress. If the session has gone through a gate, players waiting in the character select cannot rejoin until the next cycle.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h3]Arena[/h3]<br>[list]<br>  [*]Currently offers both Free-For-All, and Teams PvP formats. Dens open when there's only one scug/team left standing, or when the rain comes.<br>  [*]All arenas from installed mods are always available for selection, including those normally exclusive to Downpour's challenge mode.<br>  [*]A countdown timer blocks all methods of attack at the start of each round, ensuring all players have a chance to grab weapons and spread out.<br>  [*]In addition to 'standard' arena configuration, the host can change things like how long the countdown timer should last, or whether Saint should use ascension or spears.<br>  [*]The host can ban any number of slugcats from being selected, by selecting their portrait in the character select and pressing grab.<br>[/list]<br><br>[hr][/hr]<br>[h2]Communication and moderation (Story and Arena only)[/h2]<br>[list]<br>  [*]Press 'Enter' to open the chatbar, and 'Comma' to toggle the chatlog's visibility.<br>  [*]Press 'J' to toggle usernames and player icons, and 'P' to toggle a ping display next to player names.<br>  [*]Press 'Tab' to open the spectator menu; you can click on other (live) players' usernames to switch your camera to them. The button next to each player will let non-hosts mute or unmute them, and let hosts permanently kick them from the lobby instance.<br>  [*]Lobby hosts can tweak required and disallowed mods by opening Meadow's settings in the remix menu; the 'General' tab has buttons that will open the configuration files for each in your default text editor.<br>[/list]<br><br>[hr][/hr]<br>[h2]Modding[/h2]<br>Meadow supports other mods adding custom gamemodes, as well as custom variations for arena mode.

The Nightstriker is an original slugcat designed by my friend, PPMiecoo.

If you encounter any bugs or issues, feel free to leave a comment. If possible, providing the ExceptionLog file from your local game directory when errors occur would be especially helpful!<br><br>This mod was made possible thanks to the support of many developers in the community. In particular, Quaeledy (creator of The Outsider) and Tricrystal (creator of The Vanguard) helped answer countless questions and provided solutions throughout the process. I also referenced many tutorials from community modders. Additionally, the members of the Dev group and the SlugBase developers offered immense help.<br>Without the assistance of the Rain World community, this mod would never have been possible.<br><br>Thank you so, so much to every developer and friend who helped me along the way!<br>",

(Also changed LM_C11 subregion to none, for consistency)<br>- Re-adds the asset for BM_SI_STRUT, which fixes the song not playing, rooms and triggers are actually unchanged<br><br>Known issues with this mod being enabled:<br>- MusicEvents in DevTools will show BM_SI_STRUT as the only available song unless RegionKit is also installed<br>- The map shows broken room connections between SL_C11 and the neighbouring rooms. The connections still function, they just don't render properly<br><br>If anyone knows how to fix these, do get in touch via Discord @maltmilkshake :)",

As the name suggests, it prevents you from dying when falling off the map.<br>(Now updated to v0.1.5!)<br><br>Compatibility:<br>Applicable to: Player | Slugpup | Tamed Lizards | Special Items<br>Works on creatures controlled by safariControl<br>Supports multiplayer mode<br>Now compatible with playable characters added by the 'not slugcat playables' MOD!<br>(Note: Full adaptation is only guaranteed for Player Scavenger and Player Lizard. For Rot, only the legacy floating mechanic is supported. As for ParasiteSpider, floating mode prevents falling off the map, but it cannot be lifted back up.)<br><br>Details:<br>Updated! Some legacy features have been removed (can be re-enabled in settings. [spoiler]If you enjoy using the void as a trampoline...[/spoiler]).<br>Current behavior:<br>When falling off the map, the player is teleported to the last safe position (a place the player previously stood on, adjusted with a touch of 'black tech' correction algorithm).<br>Key items and tamed lizards falling off the map will be teleported to valid ground near a player, accompanied by a noticeable visual effect to ensure you spot them.<br><br>Legacy Version (can be re-enabled in settings):<br>[strike]<br>Resets downward velocity upon falling off the map and applies upward acceleration.<br>Grants 50 ticks of floating after falling. Holding the [i]Up Key[/i] extends floating duration (up to 100 ticks).<br>Enough to glide across more than a screen's distance (useful for special terrain).<br>Press the [i]Down Key[/i] during floating to end it early.<br>Slugpup's floating duration is 1.5x longer (75–150 ticks).<br>Lizards' floating duration is 1.5x longer (fixed 150 ticks).<br>[/strike]<br><br>Note:<br>The taming detection logic checks whether [AI.friendTracker.friend] is null. [strike]Not sure what issues this might cause, but at least it works.[/strike]<br><br>Changelog:<br>May 17: Minor update – resolved compatibility issues with other mods.<br>Nov 13: v0.1.0 – improved related code.<br>Nov 15: v0.1.5 – partial support for 'not slugcat playables' content (kind of....).<br><br>New to modding – bug reports are appreciated!",

NSH implanted an old biomass reactor, given by someone else, into its body to maintain the fragile balance of its physical form. However, it eventually died, and NSH had no choice but to abandon it. Yet, the fungi within it did not give up, struggling to keep the organs functioning and eventually finding an opportunity to revive its host. The Mutant awoke once again.

Customize your board, complete challenges, or compete for goals with other players!! <br><br>[b]I recommend watching the two videos above for a good overview/explanation of what Bingo Mode is about![/b]<br><br><br>[b]You'll get a lot of this through checking the mod out, but I want to give a quick description as well:[/b]<br>Available in the Expedition menu is an alternative gamemode built on top of Expedition. Remember that Bingo and Expedition saves are shared!<br><br>When in the bingo menu, you can hover over any challenge to find out its goal, click on any of them to customize specific values or change the challenge type alltogether, change the board size, and other cool things!<br><br>Multiplayer in Bingo is started by pressing the 'Multiplayer' (wow) toggle in the top left corner. There, you might create or join a lobby! The host may pick everyone's teams, which can decide if you want to cooperate or play competitively!<br>In Multiplayer, only the board states are shared online, you won't see actual other player slugcats!<br>You may choose to play one of three gamemodes when playing multiplayer:<br>[list]<br>    [*]Bingo - Completing any single line of goals counts as a win<br>    [*]Lockout - Completing a goal prevents all of the other teams from completing the same one, you win the same as in Bingo gamemode, or through getting more than half of the squares, while all other teams are locked out of getting a bingo line.<br>    [*]Blackout - Only completing [i]every[/i] goal counts as a win<br>[/list]<br><br>While in game, you may open the bingo board HUD using your specified keybind (remember to rebind it in the Remix settings!) - Space by default. There you can view your progress on all the goals!<br>In there, you may also 'Tally up' - count goal completions for each team and conclude the game for everyone, if you wish to end early!<br><br>If you ever want to view copied bingo boards outside of the game, please check out the [url=https://t3sl4co1l.github.io/bingovista/bingovista.html]Bingo Mod Board Viewer[/url] made by T3sl4co1l!<br><br><br>[b]Happy Bingoing! Hope you enjoy your stay. There's a lot more to discover![/b]<br><br>[h3]Mod compatibility[/h3]<br>This mod is probably incompatible with Rain Meadow. Otherwise, when it comes to region or slugcat mods, they should work in bingo fine! I can't guarantee compatibility though.<br><br>[h3]Open source[/h3]<br>This mod is open source! Check it out on github here: https://github.com/Nacu0021/BingoMode<br>Feel free to make pull requests with new additions, improvements, and other things! If it's proven to work and be stable and cool, I (or someone else) will gladly add your features to this mod!<br>Me personally, I won't be updating this mod unless to fix it due to bugs/breaking changes (watcher dlc), so I give control of new features to anyone interested and commited!

However, without any kind of information about whether or not an echo is in any given region -- and it isn't clear which ones do and don't -- there's no easy way of knowing if you should spend time scouring a given area or if you'd be wasting your time.<br><br>Saint's campaign is also based around finding echoes and it has a preexisting effect that effectively prevents this issue entirely. I'm not sure why something like it wasn't included with Watcher's campaign, so I implemented it here.[/spoiler]<br><br>Please let me know if you run into issues! I developed this primarily for myself mid-playthrough to resolve the lack of signposting in Watcher's campaign, and it's very plausible I missed something.<br><br>You can find this mod's source code on [url=https://github.com/Ilysen/WatcherEchoPing]GitHub[/url], under the GPL v3 license. You can also find non-Workshop releases here, if you're on another platform.<br><br>[h1]I found a bug![/h1]<br>If you have other mods enabled, disable them first -- make absolutely sure that this mod is the one that's causing your problem, and see if the issue happens on vanilla too. If the issue persists, give me as many details as possible; reproduction steps, your platform, things like that. If you can provide your log file (BepInEx/LogOutput.log in the game directory) on pastebin or something, it would help a lot.<br><br>[b]Bug reports without actionable information will be ignored.[/b] I can't fix issues if I don't know what's causing them!<br><br>[h1]Donations[/h1]<br>I am not in this for the cash and I am never going to stop maintaining things even if I don't earn from them, but if you feel like giving support, you can use my Ko-fi link: https://ko-fi.com/ceresetal",

"desc": "[h1]Iterator Lightning[/h1]<br>The Watcher DLC brought a brand new lightning system into the game but places like Shaded Citadel still use the old background-flash lightning even with the DLC enabled. This mod aims to fix that by bringing the lightning of Stormy Coast to vanilla and Downpour locations such as Memory Crypts, Underhang, Waterfront Facility, and Vents, giving iterator superstructures the lightning they deserve! <br><br>And while it produces spectacular sights in the background, it isn’t harmless. In Memory Crypts and Waterfront Facility, you may need to look out for lightning striking parts of the room as you traverse it, much like in Stormy Coast. Perhaps you can use it to your advantage against the likes of the Miros Birds?",

"desc": "Massive rework mod for Watcher's rift regions. Includes palette changes, creature spawn changes, new and reworked connections, and core gameplay changes. Originally this was meant to just add more MSC creatures to Watcher regions and was mostly meant for personal use, then it spiralled out of control into what it is now and I'm still trying to make it suitable for the general public instead of just myself. Most reworks are meant to recapture the experience of playing various modded regions for the first time, so if you're familiar with custom regions you might have some fun recognizing certain elements.<br>Obviously does not affect Watcher's intro regions (the ones from the base game) since those are not rift regions. Highly recommended that you restart Watcher's campaign for this, obviously.<br><br>!! -Examples & Highlights To Grab Your Attention- !!<br>- Outer Rim's wind blows toward The Throne instead of away from it<br>- Coral Caves has much less static visuals<br>- Heat Ducts and Thermal Relay use objects from the Shrouded Assembly mod<br>- All of the Aether Ridge regions are much more unique from each other and have improved visuals<br>- Shrouded Coast has its old gimmick from the mod version<br>- Verdant Waterways is overgrown with foliage and has only green creatures in it<br>- Badlands has less locusts and more spore puffs<br>- Over half the regions in the campaign have different end-of-cycle effects<br>- Fetid Glen is much smaller and it's a lot easier to see in it<br>- The rotten base game regions have spawns that fit much better<br><br>Important! The mod adds and changes several rift connections, so the interactive map you can find online is not 100% reliable now. You can use the in-game map but if you'd like to see them before playing, a semi-comprehensive list of them is in the pinned discussion post or in the 'notes-rifts.txt' file if you know how to access the files for this mod.<br><br>Some changes cause the in-game map to display incorrect water levels or not display terrain correctly, and fixing them would require manually remaking the map image files, since the program I use to generate maps and room connections does not account for those changes.<br>Additionally, the new rifts added by the mod sometimes like to 'double' their visual effects, meaning they display as two rifts in the exact same spot, but it shouldn't have any gameplay impact and will be fixed next update.<br><br>HIGHLY recommended that you play this with Watcher QOL, that mod adds some new obscure creature interactions which this one makes more common.<br>Stay tuned for future updates!

"desc": "So, Aether Ridge was one of my favorite region mods from back in the day before downpour. When I saw it in the screenshots for the Watcher DLC I was super excited to finally have a port of this legendary region for modern versions of rain world!<br><br>Unfortunately the version of Aether Ridge that we got in the DLC is lacking in many regards (in my opinion)! The entire region, which was notorious for being enormous, has now been sliced up into 5 separate small regions that do not connect to each other in the way they were originally meant to. All of the lore pearls, echos, and gate connections are gone as well. Personally, I think this is a BAD way to experience Aether Ridge. but sadly this is now the first time experience for many players.<br><br><br>[h2] Ok, enough of the tirade, what is this mod? [/h2]<br><br>This is an attempt to restore Aether Ridge to the way it was prior to the Watcher (or at least as close as I can manage). That means re-adding gates to Sky Islands and Subterranean, lore pearls, and most importantly reconnecting all the subregions so that our beloved desalination rig can be whole once more!<br><br>One concession though: since the subregions were moved into their own region prefixes, moving all the rooms back into a single region would require renaming every single room file. Since I do not have the know-how to automate that or the free time to do it manually, I will compromise and add gates where the subregions used to connect. It's not a perfectly faithful fix, but this is the only way I can maintain my sanity while doing this.<br><br>This mod is intended to be used while playing as vanilla slugcats. Having gates for Watcher would allow them to access sky islands and sub, which is not intended and would probably cause progression issues, if not game breaking bugs! So, consider only using this mod while playing as Monk, Survivor, or Hunter!<br><br>I will not be making any new content in this mod. Everything will either be pulled from the Watcher's version of AR or from the old version on RainDB!<br><br>It would be really funny if it turns out the original creator is planning to upload a direct port of AR to the workshop, which would make all this obsolete... But as much as I hope and pray that we get an official port, I feel like AR's inclusion in this condition in a paid DLC is kinda the nail in the coffin for that hope.<br><br><br>Currently implemented:<br>- Echo + unique echo song (Special thanks to Dag_ed for decrypting the echo dialogue!)<br>- Unlockable arenas<br>- Lore pearls<br>- Sky Islands gate + rooms leading up to the gate<br>- Subterranean gate + rooms leading up to the gate<br>- Gates connecting all AR subregions together* as they did prior to Watcher<br>	*Mostly. Since there can't be more than two gates between the same two regions there are two connections between 'Aether Ridge' and 'Heat Ducts' that are no longer with us. I tried to keep the connections that seemed the most impactful.<br>- Restored the old versions of rooms WARE_I01x, WARG_G06, AND WARG_G22<br>- Removed the blue lizard in WARF_A01<br>- Disconnected rooms leading to Fallen Tramway (Saint version of Arial Tramway)<br>- Removed cosmetic rifts from rooms that have portals for Watcher<br><br>Planned:<br>- Re-add gate to Coral Caves<br>- Re-add region art<br>- Make subregion gates usable multiple times per cycle<br>- Maybe re-add gate to Gilded Sanctuary?<br>- Maybe restore old color palette in Cold Storage?<br>- Maybe make unique gates instead of copying the same one?<br><br>Let me know if I missed any connections or if it's broken or anything else important! Have a nice day!<br>",

"desc": "[h2]The Ambulant (Lite)[/h2]This mod (mostly) replaces Hunter with Ambulant, a slugcat of whom is from a different mod I’m currently developing. Mainly meant so that I could actually play Ambulant on Meadow’s Arena mode (since SlugBase screws up Meadow A LOT), but I won’t stop you from using the mod for other purposes. [u]In Arena, Ambulant is a little above Hunter, but definitely lower-tier than the likes of Rivulet or Artificer.[/u]I don’t plan on TOO much upkeep of this mod, but feel free to comment on any bugs you find that you can confirm are specific to this mod. [u]Also, if you don’t want players using this mod, you can just put nassoc.ambulantlite at the bottom of the meadow-bannedmods.txt file of your StreamingAssets folder.[/u]Also, I’m not gonna be releasing movement documentation until the actual full mod comes out, sorry… (Don’t worry, there are no key combinations or overpowered tech!)Some differences between this mod and the main mod:- Main uses SlugBase, this replaces Hunter.- All non-code-mod content is removed here, such as CRS Challenges or easter eggs.- Main is incompatible with Meadow unless everyone has it, this is compatible as a client-side mod.- Main has Dress My Slugcat textures, this doesn’t. (If you really feel like it, use b03b27 for the most accurate coloring.)Some known bugs I probably won’t fix:- The Hunter passage is named The Ambulant passage :troll:- 'Throwless Boosting'  SOMETIMES doesn’t work in any Meadow online mode (even as host) for some reason (most notably before PVP starts), presumably because throwing is handled differently online.- Any entity-related stuff such as rolling off Dart Maggots doesn't work unless you are the host, due to the fact that Dart Maggots' movement and attachment status are handled by the host, not the client.Also, go check out the [url=https://rainworldmods.miraheze.org/wiki/Ambulant_(Lite)]wiki page[/url]!",

So, fret not to give suggestions, they are always welcome!<br><br>Right now, besides Outskirts, are planned fully new worldstates only for Chimney Canopy, Industrial Complex and secret little tweaks for certain regions that I will not name here.<br><br>Know this, though.

[/b]<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The Seeker is an android created by some iterator for pearl data collecting, having a similar appearance with iterator puppets.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[h1]【Features】[/h1]<br>[b]1. Unique Diet[/b]<br>Despite ordinary food, you can digest most items by swallowing then into stomach.<br>The food pips you get varies depends on the type of items.<br><br>[b]2. Pearl Reading[/b]<br>Swallow the pearl to start a pearl reading! Spitting the pearl out will end the reading instantly.<br>   - Remote Pearl Reading: After meeting Looks to the Moon, a small selection menu will pop out for you. Press '←/→' direction arrows to switch the reader, and then press 'Jump' to start reading. (Right: Moon, Left: Seeker)<br>   - Self Pearl Reading: Seeker has new reading dialogue for most vanilla and MSC pearls, some contain original lore, and some are summaries. [b]Except for the broadcast pearls and mod pearls, these pearls are encrypted for Seeker, and can only be read by Moon or Five Pebbles)[/b]<br>   - This pearl contains mild Watcher spoiler: the green pearl in Filtration System.<br><br>** For other slugcats, you can enable remote reading in the mod's Remix menu! And Moon will be your reader then.<br><br>[b]3.Pearl Reading Record[/b]<br>Every unique colored pearl (including mod pearls) swallowed by Seeker will be recorded and displayed on it select menu CG. Max of 14 (20 if MSC enabled) pearls will be displayed on the select menu CG.<br>   - [b]You don’t need to read all the lines to record the pearl,[/b] the pearl will be recorded as long as you swallowed it once.<br><br>[b]4. Hook Rope[/b]<br>Despite the appearance, it acts same as tube worms or Saint's tongue.<br><br>[b]5. Pearl Detecting[/b]<br>When there's a colored pearl in the room, an red indicator will automatically appear to guide you to the pearl position.<br>    - White pearls, Pebbles' s pearls and Pearlcat's exclusive pearls will not be detected.<br>    - For Spearmaster broadcast pearls (pale colored ones) have a different indicator color : pale blue<br>    - When there are multiple colored pearl in one room, you can press 'Right Ctrl' to randomly relocate a colored pearl.<br><br>[b]6. Duration / High Damage Resistance[/b]<br>The metal body can strongly withstand most type of damage (except electric one) at the cost of its duration.<br>Each time you receive damage, you lose a specific amount of duration. <br>    - You can tell the remaining amount of duration by the small UI at left side of your screen. When the duration drops to 0, you will lose all the extra resistance and become fragile.<br>    - In jolly-coop mode, duration UI will be shown for all Seeker players from bottom to top.<br><br>[b]7.Outer Expanse / Metropolis gate hacking[/b]<br>You can force the locked OE and Metropolis gate open by simply standing there.<br><br>[b]8. Remix Menu[/b]<br>This mod has its own remix menu to adjust the duration and match some of your cosmetic needs.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>[h1]【Ending】[/h1]<br>- 1 Special ending : Go to the top of Communication Array with at least 14 (20 if MSC enabled) pearl reading records (including mod pearls).<br>- [i]No ascension ending.

Features 36 rooms, 2 shelters, and 2 rifts. This region is late game and can only be reached or explored by players with maximum Ripple.<br><br>[Spoiler]Ripple jumps (& pounces, walljumps, etc.) are a required tech to fully explore this region. To perform a ripple jump or pounce, tap the Special button slightly before the jump to reduce your gravity. Ripple walljumps can also be performed during the end of a levitation, to get some extra height.[/spoiler]Wallbounces are recommended to use, but the region is technically fully explorable without them.<br><br>This region is best explored with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3456729866] Endless Karma Flowers [/url] mod, to prevent loss of Ripple and [spoiler]levitation[/spoiler] on death.

"desc": "Are you interested in Rain World’s tech and glitches? This is the mod for you! With over 60 rooms of puzzles split between 5 regions, players of all skill levels will find a challenge made for them! From the calming Vibrant Shores to the fiery Icebreaker, can you collect all 30 colored pearls?<br><br>Rules:<br> - Play as Hunter- the portal is right next to your spawn! Increasing your cycle count is recommended.<br> - Make sure the “Vanilla Exploits” remix setting is on. Many solutions will not work if it is off!<br> - For the intended solutions, don’t bring anything between the puzzle regions. Bringing things into or out of the hub is allowed.<br><br>Solutions and hints: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l7I0J0uXzxAmciCAmLxXHbLLsN2cTyNwAfYp8bumFwI/edit?usp=sharing<br><br>FAQ:<br>Q: How hard are the puzzles? <br>A: All the puzzles are focused on knowledge rather than execution, and no precise movement is required for any region. As for the knowledge you’ll need, it depends- each region has puzzles around a certain difficulty. Vibrant Shores is the easiest, and a clever player without any prior knowledge of tech could reach most pearls. The other regions gradually ramp up in difficulty, until you reach the Algae Vats; very few players will be able to collect all the pearls here. <br><br>Q: The portals aren’t working! <br>A: Shelter, then try again. Hunter isn’t able to enter more than one portal per cycle, this is a limitation of the game that I can’t change.<br><br>Q: How many pearls are in each region?<br>A: The blue lights near each portal in the hub show the amount of pearls in each region. You can also use a mod such as “Extended Collectibles Tracker” https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3244633122 to track your progress. Note that none of the pearls have custom dialogue!<br><br>Q: I’m stuck, where do I ask for help? <br>A: The doc above has hints and all the puzzle solutions players have found so far. If you need more help, the #movement channel in the Rain World discord is the best place to ask for help. Also check out the tech iceberg thread in that channel, as well as its respective doc; these are good resources explaining every tech in the game.",

It's hopefully an overall gameplay improvement, focusing on making traversal a lot easier since the anti-gravity hardly ever goes to full 100%.

Press special to change modes)<br>- Can change ammo type while holding grab button and pressing special (requires 1 food)<br>- Replaces Cherrybomb ammo with an upgraded version.<br> - Can hold 2 rifles at once.<br><br>Raiju: (You need watcher dlc for this one to work)<br>- Is immune to thunder strikes<br>- Pressing special will give Raiju 1 charge (requires 3 food)<br>- When Raiju hits an enemy with a rock or spear he loses 1 charge, but thunder will strike near the hit point<br>- If you press special when Raiju has 3 charges, he will do the balanced thing (doesn't require food)<br>- Charges buff Raiju's speed (more charges more speed)<br>- If Raiju gets hit by a something piercing (spear, king vulture harpoon ect.) he doesn't die immediately, but gains infinite charges and still dies a bit after.<br><br>KOMAHDNP:<br>- I RECOMMEND to have only one KOMAHDNP in a team.<br>- After saving KOMAHDNP transforms any object in stomach into neuron.<br>- If he has a neuron in his stomach, he gains access to orders:<br>SUPPLY!!!

(Special + Throw)<br>Strikes enemies with bombs from the sky (takes 1 food per target)<br>MOTIVATE!!! (Special + Jump)<br>Makes every alive player faster (takes 1 food per each player and stacks)<br>- If he dies every other players die too (you can change behavior or remove it in options)<br>- While you have him in team every player becomes faster every time player kills an enemy.<br><br>Delirium:<br>- Every 1 second his colors, speed, grabbed and swallowed items are randomized.<br>- Food gain is also randomized.<br>- Pressing special will randomize every item and creature in room, but it has 1 in 3 chance to replace Delirium with 3 random items (death).<br><br>Downpour K.A.R.M.A: Spear Sharpened with Rain (SSWR):<br>- Can transform spears into rapiers (new type of spears) (requires 1 food)<br>- Rapiers can't stick into walls or creatures<br>- Rapiers pierce through enemies so you can hit multiple enemies with 1 spear<br>- Each pierce reduces damage to next enemy it hits <br>- Rapiers return to you after you throw them<br>- SSWR has a sanity stat that:<br>Increases by 5 when player gets 1 food pip<br>Increases by 10 when an enemy died<br>Decreases by 20 when a player died<br>Decreases by damage that dealt to a player<br>Has a maximum value of 45 and a minimum value -45<br>- If SSWR has negative amount of sanity it will decrease until it reaches -40<br>- if SSWR has -45 sanity it resets to 0 and she gets stunned for 10 seconds and can't gain or lose sanity during this period<br>- For each ten absolute value of sanity SSWR gets 1 Rapier that flies around her (3 max)<br>- Also gets more speed for more sanity absolute value<br>- These rapiers have different characteristics based on SSWR's current sanity:<br>For Negative:<br>- Deal more damage the less sanity SSWR has<br>Positive:<br>- Consume 10 sanity to save yourself from lethal attack<br><br>- Pressing special will throw one of these rapiers<br><br>Mod is unfinished!!!",

This proof-of-concept may seem underwhelming, but I am excited to grow this mod; and you can help greatly, even if you can't code!<br>To experience the demo, restart Survivor's campaign. If you just want to play around freely with the features of this mod, then select your abilities in the Remix config menu for this mod, and play in any campaign except Survivor's. It is recommended to play with Improved Input Config for 1.11, especially if you want to experiment with this mod in co-op.<br><br>The primary goal of this mod is to make exploring Rain World fun. This will be done by adding Metroidvania-style upgrades and abilities to be found throughout the world. To compensate for this, the world will be almost entirely re-arranged, and new challenges will be added.<br>My hope for this mod is to incorporate a great many community-made region mods. I am frustrated that there are so many amazing region mods, yet I cannot much enjoy exploring them simply for the sake of exploring. But if regions had collectible upgrades, keys to other regions, and maybe even boss fights...? Sounds way more fun.<br><br>If you are interested in this project, let me know. Almost anyone can help with this mod somehow: Playtesting, Artwork, Spritework, Music, Story conceptual design, Mechanic suggestions, Coding (creatures, items, misc): all of that would help immensely. But especially, designing the world map (finding which regions to use and/or rearranging them) - I need help with that.<br>...anyone want to design a Metroidvania game map?<br><br>Additions:<br>Adding gliding. ...I did my best to implement physically-accurate drag and lift mechanics in order to turn the slugcat into a paper airplane. Add some thrust and you have yourself a slugcat airplane. Gliding feels criminally satifying on a controller.<br>Added a freaking inventory system what on earth was I thinking??? It works alright, though.<br>And there's now a pause menu for you to edit your inventory selection. And we have jolly-coop support and Improved Input Config support! ...don't ask how long they took to implement...",

However, if I find a ground-breaking bug, or feel like some slugcats need more balancing, they may have their abilities tweaked alittle.

I'm all for tips and suggestion, but I won't take them blindly either.

Its pounce are shorter but longer, and it has alot of new movement tech regarding walls and poles !<br>To start gripping on walls, simply hold up while being against one. From there, you can press jump to do a Wall Climb, and press jump again to do a Wall Vertical pounce (you read it right, [i]vertical[/i]). You can also do a Wall Kick by pressing the opposing direction (of the wall) and jump shortly after leaving the wall.<br>When pouncing, or flipping, you can also kick your enemies by pressing jump while holding forward. A risky tech with cheap damage, but good knockback (depending on the creature's weight)<br><br>[h3]The Core[/h3]<br>The Core uses the full capacity of its core to its advantage. As long as you have energy, it has the best mobility of the 3 slugcats. Your jump is replaced by a leap you can charge !<br>Hold jump to charge, and release to take off ! While doing a flip, you can also hold jump to be floatier ! Be careful though, as every of those moves uses energy. If you happen to run of energy and enter meltdown mode, don't panic ! You just have to hold grab while not moving and you'll be all fine again.<br><br>[h3]The Spark[/h3]<br>The Spark may be weak in nature, but has the uncommon ability to be able to gerenerate static electricity. It can be used for defense as well as for movement, but be careful to not eletrocute yourself !<br>Your static energy is your best friend, you even use it to throw spears better than you muscles will allow you. To charge, you just need to move around, or crouch and hold special and down at the same time. Then, you can use the energy you have into a small discharge of electricity by pressing special ! The ability will change functions depending on the context (flipping, being on a pole, sliding/rolling, pouncing...) and if you are overcharged or not.<br><br><br>[h2]Dev Tool commands : [/h2]<br><br>[T] : Spark full charge / Core full energy<br>[T + Shift] : infinite Spark overcharge immunity / Core energy set at 0<br>[T + Control] : infinite Spark endless charge / Core energy set at minimun<br><br>In Arena :<br>[L] : Force Kill<br>[L + Shift] : Arena Shield<br>[L + Control] : Arena Lifes (set to 3)<br>[L + Alt] : Spawns a random item from the test pool<br><br>[h2]Arena : [/h2]<br><br>(For now only in Meadow)<br>You can enable the lifes systen in arena !

"desc": "Make sure to select the aspect ratio in the options menu (not the remix menu).<br><br>This mod lets you experience true pixel-perfect Rain World graphics! There is a downside, however: the resolution is cropped to 720p, and some UI elements will be cropped as well, but it’s still perfectly playable. If you have a 1440p or 2160p monitor, just set the game to fullscreen and it will be integer-upscaled automatically. Don’t let the cropping scare you, because when the player moves to the edge of the screen, the camera will move smoothly so you can see the cropped area.<br><br>It works on 1080p as well, but it uses nearest-neighbour upscaling instead. Unfortunately, 1080p won’t be pixel-perfect, but it will still look significantly better than upscaling 768p to 1080p, because 1080 / 768 ≈ 1.4 (which is most noticeable when looking at poles, some appear thick, others thin) whereas 1080 / 720 = 1.5 (so all poles have an even thickness).<br><br>Enjoy the intended Rain World graphics!<br><br>UPDATE: Added more aspect ratio support, including ultrawide! The maximum width is now 17:9, and the image will no longer be stretched to fit the display width in ultrawide.<br><br>UPDATE 2: Wide aspect ratios no longer stretch the height on standard screens (in case you want to use them for some reason). You can now press Left Control / Right Control (keyboard) or L3 / R3 (joystick) to access the cropped area (minor visual glitches may occur). The expedition list is no longer cropped. Some code has also been optimized so that certain functions no longer run unnecessarily.<br><br>UPDATE 3: Optimized Update 2 because it caused conflicts with other mods. Holding Ctrl will now produce significant visual glitches, so use it only when necessary.",

Other creatures interact with it as if it was a red lizard, plus some extra interactions. Mostly found at Outskirts and Industrial Complex.<br><br><br><br><br>This mod adds a new lizard to the game, that is, the false red lizard!<br><br>Devious, territorial, and with a good sense of self-preservation.<br><br>Similarly to some creatures in real life, these lizards borrow the reputation of another well-known denizen of Rain World in order to increase their own odds of survival. Generally, their relations with other creatures are the same as that of red lizards, which means that other lizards will respect false red lizards and won't be nearly as snappy to them. However, their physical prowess and abilities are the same as those of a humble pink lizard.<br><br>They do have some unique key interactions, differing from true red lizards:<br><br>-False red lizards are just as territorial as true red lizards, which means that like them, they will immediately go hostile against members of their own species. Unlike most creatures, they can tell each other apart from actual red lizards.<br><br>-True red lizards, however, can't differentiate a false red from their own, so they will try to kill them on sight as they would with other true reds. The false red will do its best to flee instead, as it very well knows it can't win the fight.<br><br>-While a true red lizard is able to fight back vultures, a false red lizard won't try, and so it will flee like normal.<br><br>This mod comes together with all the necessary spawns to add false red lizards to the Vanilla experience, which means that upon installing the mod, players can start a new save and they will soon see the new lizard in their game.<br>The populations are most dense in regions like Outskirts and Industrial Complex, but some can be seen in Industrial Complex and Farm arrays as well. If pink lizards thrive in a region, chances are the similarly-built false red will too! The mod includes the false red lizard in lineages thorought the game, so not many will be seen right away, but there's a few assured spawns here and there.<br><br>False red lizards should be compatible with most mods as long as they don't heavily edit spawns in Vanilla regions or add a lot of rooms to them. I'd be thankful if people who find any incompatibilities notified me on the comments so that I can make a list of known incompatibilities in the near future. While I don't plan on adding any actual extra content not related to false red lizards in this mod, I will do my best to fix any bugs that may arise and to keep up with Rain World's updates. Eventually, I will be making it so Lizard Customizer isn't required for the mod to work. Thank you for trying out my mod!",

Other creatures interact with it as if it was a red lizard, plus some extra interactions. Mostly found at Outskirts and Industrial Complex.<br><br><br><br><br>This mod adds a new lizard to the game, that is, the false red lizard!<br><br>Devious, territorial, and with a good sense of self-preservation.<br><br>Similarly to some creatures in real life, these lizards borrow the reputation of another well-known denizen of Rain World in order to increase their own odds of survival. Generally, their relations with other creatures are the same as that of red lizards, which means that other lizards will respect false red lizards and won't be nearly as snappy to them. However, their physical prowess and abilities are the same as those of a humble pink lizard.<br><br>They do have some unique key interactions, differing from true red lizards:<br><br>-False red lizards are just as territorial as true red lizards, which means that like them, they will immediately go hostile against members of their own species. Unlike most creatures, they can tell each other apart from actual red lizards.<br><br>-True red lizards, however, can't differentiate a false red from their own, so they will try to kill them on sight as they would with other true reds. The false red will do its best to flee instead, as it very well knows it can't win the fight.<br><br>-While a true red lizard is able to fight back vultures, a false red lizard won't try, and so it will flee like normal.<br><br>This mod comes together with all the necessary spawns to add false red lizards to the Downpour experience, which means that upon installing the mod, players can start a new save and they will soon see the new lizard in their game.<br>The populations are most dense in regions like Outskirts and Industrial Complex, but some can be seen in Industrial Complex as well. If pink lizards thrive in a region, chances are the similarly-built false red will too! The mod includes the false red lizard in lineages thorought the game, so not many will be seen right away, but there's a few assured spawns here and there.<br><br>Notes on Saint:<br>In Saint's campaign, pink lizards are completely extinct. Evolutionary speaking, it only makes sense that another creature that is basically the same thing but able to camouflage itself as a mighty red lizard would end up phasing them out, meaning that they are much more common in that campaign. This is also an excuse to be incredibly evil and shufle several false reds with the two real reds of Outskirts and Industrial Complex. :)<br><br>False red lizards should be compatible with most mods as long as they don't heavily edit spawns in Vanilla regions or add a lot of rooms to them. I'd be thankful if people who find any incompatibilities notified me on the comments so that I can make a list of known incompatibilities in the near future. While I don't plan on adding any actual extra content not related to false red lizards in this mod, I will do my best to fix any bugs that may arise and to keep up with Rain World's updates. Eventually, I will be making it so Lizard Customizer isn't required for the mod to work. Thank you for trying out my mod!",

Via checking in or being prompted at various stages, I've seen this project come together! Many ideas have come and gone, scope has creeped, and been reined back in, and through the highs and lows of passion, Foto has persevered!<br>I hope you enjoy this mod's distinct tone and atmosphere, as Hunter approaches their destination! If you are willing to accept your fate, consider spending your remaining cycles exploring our grounded iterator friend in this unique world-state.'[/quote]<br><br>[quote=Winter (Testing, minor design feedback)]<br>I was kidnapped by Foto to playtest his mod (he asked people in maincord if they wanted to playtest I think idk I forgot) and honestly I'm just glad it's coming to a close for Foto’s sake really. It's been like two years of off and on for everyone putting their ideas together to create an experience we felt Hunter deserves in MSC. <br>I unfortunately couldn't help much after a certain point because my laptop is Satan and work leaves me mentally exhausted. However, I'm certain you guys will enjoy this new experience for Hunter. I'll die if you say you didn't. Like in real life. I did wish I helped more with level editing though. That's like my biggest regret. But please. Give us feedback. This isn't the only update to Older Hunter we'll be making. Nothing drastic but we want it to be a quality experience and I'll try my best to help the team to make that happen.<br><br>Hi TotallyDutch I hope you're doing fine.[/quote]<br><br><br>[quote=Emmi (Testing, minor ideas and design feedback)]<br>I joined this dev team just a little over a year ago after expressing major excitement for the mod, specifically by accident in the Modding Gallery of Raincord. Ever since I’ve been helping the best I can with ideas and testing whenever possible!<br>This worldstate especially has captured my eyes as a contender for a canon-alternative within Downpour’s universe and Foto’s vision is easily one of the best Hunter mods I’ve seen in a while! <br>I genuinely hope y’all get to experience this mod the same way I first did when I became a tester, it is a genuine TREAT, and I think you all will love it.<br>Oh and as Winter said, there is more to come, so stay tuned![/quote]<br><br><br>[quote=Mattomo (Testing, minor design feedback)]<br>I was one of the last to join his team, September of 2024 I believe. I had reached out to Foto myself, because I love worldstate mods and the idea of Hunter getting their own worldstate. I remember the Older Hunter Garbage Wastes Preview (what a mouthful) on the workshop really impressed me. Though I can't say I did too much since the real mastermind here is Foto, but I was happy to test for him whenever he needed someone to.<br>I don't remember if it was before or after joining, but at some point I got banned from the Official Rainworld Discord due to some crazy drama. I'm grateful that Foto never kicked me out of the project and I couldn't ever thank him enough for that. (It's because I am a hermit when it comes to the RW community -F)<br><br>But back to what really matters, the mod. I hope you all enjoy the new worldstate for Hunter. I know I'll be using it as a Vanilla+ mod because it really does fit into the game nicely. He worked hard on it for a long time and you can truly see that when you play. Have fun with it![/quote]<br><br>[quote=MagicaJaphet (Coding)]<br>Peak mod idea, I had fun coding for the project and bringing a certain something to life even if that's about all I contributed. Sorry if there's incompatibilities, it was a side project after all.[/quote]<br><br><br>[h2]Help Wanted![/h2]<br>Despite my best efforts, I simply could not fix some of these things, so if you think you can help with any of the problems listed below, contact me on Discord (fotolonghimovies).<br><br>Region Art<br>Unlocks<br>",

Features wildly different new creature spawns, traversal gimmicks, palettes, visuals, and rift connections, as well as some room geometry and region layout changes.

You can use the in-game map but if you'd like to see them before playing, a semi-comprehensive list of them should be in a pinned discussion post or in the 'notes.txt' file if you know how to access the files for this mod.<br><br>Some changes cause the in-game map to display incorrect water levels or not display terrain correctly, and fixing them would require manually remaking the map image files, since the program I use to generate maps and room connections does not account for those changes. Other than that the maps should actually work though.<br><br>The game also locks you out of ending 2 (The Prince ending) with this mod, since the trigger for that tracks the actual amount of regions rotted rather than whether all the ones that currently exist are rotten. Progress toward waking him up goes noticeably faster though, so you freaks and weirdos that like talking to him can do it sooner.<br><br>[h2]Compatibility[/h2]<br>- Compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3614900034]Unfortunate Evolution Expansion[/url], for now.

Compatibility cannot be done on my end in most cases without including the mods as dependencies.<br>- Incompatible with Watcher region mods that add their rift connections in the same rooms as this one. I will work toward moving my rifts out of the way for any mods with this issue that I learn about though, as long as they do not also connect to Aether Ridge due to the aforementioned issue.<br>- Compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3050361506]Thorium Hardmode Weapon FIX[/url].",

Null-avoiders for famous problems, such as Loaches causing softlocks when being deleted from the room via commands such as Mouse Drag, or HUDs causing NRE when the player gets revived, for example when using DevConsole.<br><br>2. Quality-of-life code:<br><br>* Scavengers can now use Hazers when they don't have any better weapons. Hazers and Bubble Grass can be traded to scavengers with special conditions upping or lowering their value. For example, dead Hazer can't be traded, and Bubble Grass has 3 value in Submerged Superstructure or Shoreline.<br><br>* Reimagined trading: Scavengers now trade slightly differently and have different items that Merchants spawn with, all depending on the region.<br><br>* Yeeks no longer get sent into the atmosphere upon being mauled.<br><br>* Slugpups don't get stuck in shelter terrain upon being spawned.<br><br>* Lizards in Undergrowth, Lush Den, and Saint's Farm Arrays lack fur/thorn structures on top of their heads.<br><br>* Looks to the Moon finally describes Batnip instead of just ignoring it.<br><br>* Centipedes don't get too stretched when moving too quickly. This is especially seen when an Infant Centipede is held by a spinning Lizard.<br><br>Remix Menu shows mod names instead of their IDs.<br><br>Rain World automatically restarts after clicking 'apply changes'.<br><br>* Karma no longer gets lowered to the minimum when the game crashes. Note that it saves your karma only if the game itself crashed, not you pressing Alt + F4, the latter would definately lower your karma like you quit 30 seconds into the cycle.<br><br>* Collectible tokens that are set to unlock something, when the unlock itself doesn't exist or is invalid, won't unlock anything and will stay inactive.<br><br>3. Customisable and expandable crafting system.<br><br>4. Customizable creature dialogue boxes that follow a creature and get deleted upon switching rooms.<br><br>5. Certain code 'cheats' or 'shortcuts':<br><br>* Time-control that can be used in code to speed up or slow down time.<br><br>* Special piece of code that allows to make a certain action appear after a delay.<br><br>* Piece of code that allows loading text from .TXT files in 'YourMod/text' directory. This is exactly what's used for Iterator dialogue, but the official code is privated by creators.<br><br>* Two ways of making dialogue: one is for interrupting the current dialogue and destroying any that would've played, and the other for writing the dialogue itself.<br><br>* Small piece of code that allows locking and unlocking shortcuts like Iterators do during a conversation.<br><br>* A few nifty pieces of code that allow quickly removing any sound emitter an object or a creature has; creating temporary UpdatableAndDeletables in the room, and only once in a room it was spawned in, no clones and race-conditions; marking placed edible objects as consumed.<br><br>* Few methods that make calculating the amount of HP a creature has much easier. The amount of HP is calculated in spears hits (1 point). Some of the details that can be calculated: health of Tardigrade based on its mass; lizards: how much damage do tentacles absorb (rotten lizards only), how much damage is dealt to the head shield, how much damage is dealt to the throat; how much damage, considering the base damage resistances and extra damage resistances, is dealt to a creature; in Arena mode, the resistances are calculated by a slightly different valuable, and if the creature is set to be invinsible, the calculator shows zero damage dealt.<br><br>~And more coming~<br><br>This mod can be called finished, but I'm searching for more Rain World errors, such as Fire Sprites not deleting their light after being deleted themselves.<br><br>If you stumbled upon a bug, both of this mod and just Rain World mod, write it in the comments and I'll try to fix it when I'll have time to.",

"desc": "This is a creature relationship customiser! With this mod you can change creature dynamics on a generic level: make lizards afraid of lantern mice, make scavengers hunt deers, or anything else you fancy!<br><br>[h1]HOW TO USE[/h1]<br>[h2]1. FIRST SETUP AND LOCATION[/h2]<br>The first thing you want to do is enable the mod and load the game once. The mod will automatically create some folders for you to get started.<br><br>Now, find your Rain World installation folder (just google it if you don't know). From there, go to RainWorld_Data > StreamingAssets > WhoEatsWhom.<br>Inside WhoEatsWhom, you should see two things: a [b]Readme.txt[/b], and another folder called [b]Relationships[/b].<br><br>[h2]2. INFO ON README[/h2]<br>The [b]Readme.txt[/b] file will contain every defined relationship type (the ones you can see in the wiki), and it will contain every single creature's internal name, including modded creatures for whatever mods you had installed the last time you loaded the game.<br>You must use EXACTLY these names to create the relationship modifications!<br><br>[h2]3. CUSTOMISING RELATIONSHIPS[/h2]<br>Go into the [b]Relationships[/b] folder. Everything outside that folder will be completely ignored. Sub-folders are not supported as of yet either.<br><br>In the folder, you must create text files (.txt extension). Any names you want, as many files as you want.<br><br>Then, each of the txt files can have as many lines as you want. Each line will define a relationship modification.<br><br>[h3]RELATIONSHIP FORMATTING[/h3]<br>[b]Creature_A:Creature_B:Relationship_Type:Relationship_Intensity[/b]<br>^ This is the format that each line must follow. The creatures and the relationship type names are self-explanatory. The intensity must be number between 0 and 1, both inclusive. It can be higher than one [i]technically[/i], but it's not recommended.<br><br>[h3]FORMAT EXAMPLE[/h3]<br>[b]GreenLizard:LanternMouse:Eats:0.8[/b]<br>[b]LanternMouse:GreenLizard:Afraid:1[/b]<br>These two lines represent two relationship modifications: green lizard eats lantern mice, and lantern mice are afraid of green lizards.<br><br>[h3]OTHER FORMAT DETAILS[/h3]<br>You can introduce spaces to make it more readable:<br>[b]GreenLizard : LanternMouse : Eats : 0.8[/b]<br><br>You can add comments with the '//' symbol. Everything after the symbol in a line will be ignored.<br>[b]GreenLizard : LanternMouse : Eats : 0.8 //This is a comment.[/b]<br>[b]//LanternMouse : GreenLizard : Afraid : 1 This line is commented from the beginning, it will be ignored.[/b]<br>[b]//This line is only a comment.[/b]<br>You can also have completely empty lines to simulate paragraphs and make your files more readable.<br><br>[h2]4. HANDLING MISTAKES[/h2]<br>No matter what you write, the game should never ever crash. However, that doesn't mean every modification you did is working correctly. Every line that has a typo or doesn't follow proper formatting will be ignored and not applied.<br><br>In order to verify that everything is correct, load the game AFTER creating and saving all of your relationship files. When the game is loaded, you will see a new text file in the WhoEatsWhom folder called [b]output.txt[/b].<br><br>This output file will have every relationship line you've created. It will tag faulty lines with '(INVALID)' at the beginning of the line, and provide the reason for validity at the end of the line.<br><br>Once again, having invalid lines does not crash the game and does not impede the implementation of correct lines before or after. Every line is completely independent from the rest.<br><br>[h2]5. CONFLICTING RELATIONSIHPS[/h2]<br>If there are two or more lines that target the same creature pair (note: order matters):<br>[b]GreenLizard : LanternMouse : Eats : 0.8[/b]<br>[b]GreenLizard : LanternMouse : Ignores : 0[/b]<br>Then the mod will only apply one of them, with a defined priority:<br>-It applies the files in alphabetical order.<br>-Within each file, applies each line in order from top to bottom.<br>-The FIRST applied line has priority over the rest.<br><br>The output file will display the lines in the exact order that they are applied. When it finds a conflict, it will tag the subsequent lines with a '(WARN)'.<br><br>[h2]6. FOR MOD DEVELOPERS[/h2]<br>As of version 1.1, you can use this mod to add relationship modifications to your own mod!<br>Simply create a folder called [b]WhoEatsWhom[/b] in your mod's root directory (same directory as [b]modinfo.json[/b]). Include relationship txt files DIRECTLY in the WhoEatsWhom folder, in the same way you would use the [b]Relationships[/b] folder. The output and readme files will remain in the StreamingAssets path, though.<br><br>[h3]MOD PRIORITY[/h3]<br>The output file will also display the relationship modifications of any other mods that use Who Eats Whom. Once again, in the exact order that they are applied.<br><br>[b]Relationships defined by mods take priority over relationships defined by the user[/b], so modders can try to enforce their own customization as a part of their mod. The user can work around this if they really want to, though.<br><br>If multiple mods have conflicting relationsips, then priority will be defined by mod load order. First one takes priority.<br><br>[h3]IF YOU USE LIZARD CUSTOMIZER[/h3]<br>...Then, all lizards that have modifications enabled in Lizard Customizer will [i]probably[/i] override Who Eats Whom's relationships (most likely, but not guaranteed). I recommend defining all the lizard relationships with the customizer, and not touching lizards with Who Eats Whom, if you want to use both mods.",

"desc": "Say Goodbye to Multi-Mod Translation Conflicts and Precisely Handle All In-Game Text<br><br>This mod aims to solve the core pain points of multi-mod translation in Rain World, offering a suite of advanced features to make translation work more accurate and efficient.<br><br>---<br><br>Overview<br><br>Have you ever experienced conflicts between multiple translation mods, been unable to translate random in-game text, or had entire translation lines fail because of escape characters like /n? Advanced Translation Core (ATC) is built for this. It takes over the game's translation logic, providing powerful text preprocessing and custom tools that solve approximately 90% of complex translation scenarios.<br><br>---<br><br>Core Features<br><br>· Regex Translation Support: Precisely match and translate dynamic text, random fields, or specific patterns in the game.<br>· Escape Character Handling: Automatically processes escape characters like /n, /r, /t in text, resolving the translation failures they cause.<br>· Conflict Resolution System: Intelligently manages translation entries from multiple mods to prevent field overlap and conflicts.<br>· Custom Graphical Editor: Built-in, fully-featured GUI editor for intuitive creation, editing, and management of advanced translations.<br><br>---<br><br>How to Use<br><br>1. Enable the Editor:<br>   · In the mod's Remix config menu, find and check the 'Add button' option.<br>   · Return to the game's main menu. You will see a new button in the top-right corner of the screen. Click it to open the ATC Custom Editor.<br>2. Customize Interface Background (Optional):<br>   · To personalize the editor's appearance, simply place an image named ATC-Background-Custom.png in the Illustration folder within the mod's directory.<br>   · You can also use this file to overwrite the original background image.<br><br>---<br><br>Recommended Companion Tool<br><br>For the best translation creation experience, we highly recommend using the following tool in conjunction:<br><br>· [Translate Tools]: A powerful text capture utility. It assists in collecting all text displayed on-screen, making it an invaluable aid for translation work.<br><br>---<br><br>Important Performance Notes<br><br>Please be aware that this mod hooks deeply into the game's translation call logic, which introduces additional performance overhead.<br><br>· High-frequency translation calls may cause game stuttering.<br>· Known to cause significant frame rate drops when enabled alongside the following mods:<br>  · Translate Tools<br>  · Warp Menu Multi-language Fix<br><br>It is recommended to enable related mods judiciously based on your specific hardware and translation needs.",
