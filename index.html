I still can't open the mod's option menu.

How to fix this?<br>A: The game might actually not be frozen. The mod needs to generate files for each region. This can take time (>1 minute). Wait a bit. If the game actually crashed then you have an exceptionLog.txt file in your Rain World folder. If that is the case then proceed with the section BUG REPORTS.<br><br>Q: My game actually crashed. What happened?<br>A: Your game might have run out of memory. So far I haven't found a solution to this. As a workaround, I recommend that you restart your game from time to time (see KNOWN ISSUES).<br><br>[h1] KNOWN ISSUES [/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*]Snow shaders don't work correctly. Snow on objects is more pixelated and in some places displays more snow than vanilla and in other places less. Falling snow can 'jump' when you would have changed screens.<br>[*]There are blue outlines in certain rooms (shader issues?).<br>[*]This mod increases memory consumption. When the game runs low on memory the performance will decline and the game might crash. This might take a while (90+ minutes). Merging room texture accelerates this. This needs to happen once for every room with multiple screens. The textures are saved to disk (cached) and reused. It is recommended to restart the game every now and then.<br>CONTEXT: There might be memory leaks or memory fragmentation. A memory leak would mean that memory is not released when it is not used anymore. Fragmentation might happen because most roomCamera textures are now fairly large and change in size often. This means that they need to be re-allocated in memory often and they require a chunk of memory without 'holes'.<br>[*]The underwater shaders do not work correctly. In large rooms they can smear sprites.<br>[*]Shadows at the edge of the screen seem to flicker or stretch in some rooms. I can see the same thing without camera scroll. Maybe a vanilla bug.<br>[*]Motion sickness might be a problem. I wonder how much is due to noise (details) in the textures. You can play around with the parameters and see what works for you.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1] SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG [/h1]<br>You can find the source code, changelog and other things on GitHub:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll",

Adds sliding down slopes.<br>[*](Crawl) Crawl turns can be used to initiate rolls and on slopes. Increases turn rate in corridors.

Grab dead large creatures only when crouching.<br>[*](Roll 1) Rocket jumps from rolls have consistent height.<br>[*](Roll 2) Disabled by default. Removes the ability to chain rolls from rocket jumps (without additional height).<br>[*](Slide Turn) Disabled by default. Reduces the requirements for slide turns. Backflips are possible earlier.<br>[*](Spear Throw) The throw momentum does not affect slugcat on the ground. The momentum while climbing beams is reduced.

Removes breath limit underwater. You can eat underwater. Increases swim speed. Adjusts buoyancy.<br>[*](Tube Worm) Adds auto-aim grappling to beams. Changes affect Saint.<br>[*](Wall Climb & Wall Jump) Removes wall sliding. Normal jumps are prioritized for small obstacles instead of wall climbing / jumping.<br>[*](Wall Climb) Disabled by default.

I decided to re-upload it with a different mod id.<br><br>Q: The mod doesn't work. I can't open the mod's option menu. How to fix this?<br>A: One thing that helped multiple people is to delete the 'Rain World/BepInEx' folder and then verifying the integrity of the game files in steam.<br><br>Q: The mod still doesn't work. I still can't open the mod's option menu. How to fix this?<br>A: Maybe this more extensive strategy works for you:<br>- Delete RW completely.<br>- Then deactivate downpour on steam client so it won't download.<br>- Install RW again.<br>- Apply all mods that you want in remix and test them<br>- Continue if they work now<br>- Activate downpour on steam so it would download<br>- Activate downpour mods in remix<br>- Reboot the game<br><br>[h1] SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG [/h1]<br>You can find the source code, changelog and other things on GitHub:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SimplifiedMoveset",

Thanks again, to all the Rain World Ideas people on the Discord! The constant help is, well, helpful.<br><br>[h1][b]Explosive Daddy Long Legs[/b][/h1]<br>This variant of Daddy Long Legs can utilize a hyper-mutation that allows it to create explosions at it's tentacles, in order to stun them and catch prey easier. So, try not to get caught, if you want to live.<br><br>This creature cannot currently spawn in the base game, and you will have to manually spawn it in using the Arena, Beastmaster, or Dev Console. If using Arena or Beastmaster, the icon is a red version of the Daddy Long Legs icon.<br>It should be able to be added into a region's spawns using the name 'ell', 'explosivedll', or 'explosivedaddylonglegs'.

Right now, it only does things regarding the ZLL mainly because I was worried about small performance issues and the possible unfairness of one of it's abilities, since it could reach you off-screen in a multi-screen room.

I want players to be able to mess around and experiment with this character and their mechanics as I work on adding more content.[/b]<br><br>Face the winter storm as a new custom slugcat, the Friend! Set between the Rivulet and the Saint. This heavy slugcat, with their developed limbs, is exceptional at crawling, climbing, jumping and even throwing. However, they're clumsy at walking, so avoid standing up! They get just as much nutrition as any other slugcat from normal food, but can also eat creatures for a quarter of their regular food pips. Thanks to their fatty tail, they can store food better than most for when resources are scarce. This soft survivalist makes the most with what they have, and can maul. Making meals out of the weak is not their preferred diet, but in the frozen wasteland, it's hard to be picky. Especially when their lizards get hungry.<br><br>This mod currently adds 2 custom creatures (which cannot be found in the campaign yet), and significantly decreased food in all regions except for Undergrowth.<br><br>[u]KNOWN ISSUES:[/u]<br>- The Friend is missing an ascended portrait. There's no void sea for them to ascend into, so it doesn't matter yet.<br>- The Friend may not work as intended in co-op modes, and I'm not interested in fixing bugs related to that yet.<br><br>[u]PLANNED:[/u]<br>- Intro and ending cutscenes<br>- 3 custom creatures exclusive to the Friend's campaign<br>- Custom LTTM and Pebbles Dialogue<br>- For Saint and Friend, a new subregion of Subterranean that connects it to Outer Expanse<br>- A new region which [spoiler]combines Silent Construct and the Rot (aka, Pebbles will be at the height of his rotting)[/spoiler]<br><br>[u]KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES:[/u]<br>Singleplayer Co-op Emotes (breaks Friend's movement.

With Nueron and ritual I bent every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried gateways, exhausting what remained of our family fortune on swarthy slugcats and sturdy spears.<br><br>At last in the void soaked crags beneath the lowest roots we unearthed that damnable gateway to acension. Our every step unsettled the ancient earth but we were in a realm of death and madness. In the end I alone fled laughing and wailing through those blackened caverns of antiquity until consciousness failed me.<br><br>You remember our venerable tree, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you. Return home; claim your birthright, and deliver our family from the ravenous, clutching shadows of the Darkest Slugcats<br><br>This is my second sprite mod. As you may have noticed this mod adds the darkest dungeon characters in as slug costumes<br><br>Will be releasing 3 skins per week<br>Progress will still be slow but It is gonna be more consistent from here on<br><br>Currently added:<br>Bounty hunter (Bounty Slugger)<br>Hellion (Heli Cat)<br>Flagellant (Slugellant)<br>Jester ( Slugster)<br>Plague Doctor ( Slug Doctor)<br><br>Planned:<br>All other hero's<br><br>Maybe:<br>Polish every skin to look a bit better<br>Black Reliquary hero's<br>A few mod characters<br>Color alts (unlikely)",

Blue button is palette created by you, which is located in OutputPalettes folder. Use yellow button 'New palette' to create a new palette file.<br> [b]SavePalette :[/b] Save the palette in workspace into png file. If its copy from a vanilla palette, this mod will automatically create a new palette and save it as the new palette. Newly created palette need to be save at least once inorder to show up in OutputPalettes folder.<br> Also, some details of current palette will show in a label on the top right. <br><br>[h1]Workspace : [/h1]<br>  Every rect inside workspace represent a pixel in palette texture. Click one to choose it, it will become bigger in size, and definition of current pixel will show in a label on the top left. If the pixel is in a gradient row, the hole row will also become bigger in size. If the pixel is undefined (This means game will not use current pixel as a palette color), the rect will simply not allow you to select it.<br> [b]What is gradient row : [/b]<br>      Gradient row is in order to generate gradient colors easier. Every rect in row that has a gradient label will show a small dot opon it. That means other rects which dont have label will use it as a source color to generate their own colors. Color of no label rect will lerp from the first labeled rect on the left to the first labeld rect on the right. First and last rect in row will always be labeled.<br><br>[h1]ColorPicker : [/h1]<br>   [b]ColorTape [/b] is used to select hue of picked color, rect below is used to select value and saturation. (Just a HSV color you know)<br>    A small rect on the right of tape is used to show current picked color.<br> [b]SetCol :[/b] Set the color of current selected rect in workspace to picked color. If current rect is in row and not labeled, a label will be added.<br>  [b]RemoveLabel : [/b] Remove label of selected rect if it is labeled. <br>  [b]Pick Color : [/b] Click this to pick a color on screen of current mouse position.<br><br>[h1]More infos: [/h1]<br>   Github : https://github.com/pkuyo/PaletteCreator<br>    [b]After finish creating a new palette, you need to move it to Palettes folder in your own mod folder in order to use it.
