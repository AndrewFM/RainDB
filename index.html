Apparently this mod already 'exists' by another author. :/<br><br>Q: The mod doesn't work. I can't open the mod's option menu. How to fix this?<br>A: One thing that helped multiple people is to delete the 'Rain World/BepInEx' folder and then verifying the integrity of the game files in steam.<br><br>Q: The mod still doesn't work. I still can't open the mod's option menu. How to fix this?<br>A: Maybe this more extensive strategy works for you:<br>- Delete RW completely.<br>- Then deactivate downpour on steam client so it won't download.<br>- Install RW again.<br>- Apply all mods that you want in remix and test them<br>- Continue if they work now<br>- Activate downpour on steam so it would download<br>- Activate downpour mods in remix<br>- Reboot the game<br><br>Q: The game freezes when entering a region. How to fix this?<br>A: The game might actually not be frozen. The mod needs to generate files for each region. This can take time (>1 minute). Wait a bit. If the game actually crashed then you have an exceptionLog.txt file in your Rain World folder. If that is the case then proceed with the section BUG REPORTS.<br><br>Q: My game actually crashed. What happened?<br>A: Your game might have run out of memory. So far I haven't found a solution to this. As a workaround, I recommend that you restart your game from time to time (see KNOWN ISSUES).<br><br>[h1] KNOWN ISSUES [/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*]Snow shaders don't work correctly. Snow on objects is more pixelated and in some places displays more snow than vanilla and in other places less. Falling snow can 'jump' when you would have changed screens.<br>[*]There are blue outlines in certain rooms (shader issues?).<br>[*]This mod increases memory consumption. When the game runs low on memory the performance will decline and the game might crash. This might take a while (90+ minutes). Merging room texture accelerates this. This needs to happen once for every room with multiple screens. The textures are saved to disk (cached) and reused. It is recommended to restart the game every now and then.<br>CONTEXT: There might be memory leaks or memory fragmentation. A memory leak would mean that memory is not released when it is not used anymore. Fragmentation might happen because most roomCamera textures are now fairly large and change in size often. This means that they need to be re-allocated in memory often and they require a chunk of memory without 'holes'.<br>[*]The underwater shaders do not work correctly. In large rooms they can smear sprites.<br>[*]Shadows at the edge of the screen seem to flicker or stretch in some rooms. I can see the same thing without camera scroll. Maybe a vanilla bug.<br>[*]Motion sickness might be a problem. I wonder how much is due to noise (details) in the textures. You can play around with the parameters and see what works for you.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1] SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG [/h1]<br>You can find the source code, changelog and other things on GitHub:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll",

Adds sliding down slopes.<br>[*](Crawl) Crawl turns can be used to initiate rolls and on slopes. Increases turn rate in corridors.

Grab dead large creatures only when crouching.<br>[*](Roll 1) Rocket jumps from rolls have consistent height.<br>[*](Roll 2) Disabled by default. Removes the ability to chain rolls from rocket jumps (without additional height).<br>[*](Slide Turn) Disabled by default. Reduces the requirements for slide turns.

Removes breath limit underwater. You can eat underwater. Increases swim speed. Adjusts buoyancy.<br>[*](Tube Worm) Adds auto-aim grappling to beams. Changes affect Saint.<br>[*](Wall Climb & Wall Jump) Removes wall sliding. Normal jumps are prioritized for small obstacles instead of wall climbing / jumping.<br>[*](Wall Climb) Disabled by default.

I decided to re-upload it with a different mod id.<br><br>Q: The mod doesn't work. I can't open the mod's option menu.

I still can't open the mod's option menu. How to fix this?<br>A: Maybe this more extensive strategy works for you:<br>- Delete RW completely.<br>- Then deactivate downpour on steam client so it won't download.<br>- Install RW again.<br>- Apply all mods that you want in remix and test them<br>- Continue if they work now<br>- Activate downpour on steam so it would download<br>- Activate downpour mods in remix<br>- Reboot the game<br><br>[h1] SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG [/h1]<br>You can find the source code, changelog and other things on GitHub:<br>https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SimplifiedMoveset",

"desc": "This mod should hopefully eventually add a few different variants of DLL into the game, as long as I can figure out how to utilize the game's code and have sufficient motivation to do so. Now there's two! The [b]Explosive Long Legs[/b], which was made at the same time as Niko's version, as well as the [b]Zappy Long Legs[/b] are here now. Thanks again, to all the Rain World Ideas people on the Discord! The constant help is, well, helpful.[h1][b]Explosive Daddy Long Legs[/b][/h1]This variant of Daddy Long Legs can utilize a hyper-mutation that allows it to create explosions at it's tentacles, in order to stun them and catch prey easier. So, try not to get caught, if you want to live.This creature cannot currently spawn in the base game, and you will have to manually spawn it in using the Arena, Beastmaster, or Dev Console. If using Arena or Beastmaster, the icon is a red version of the Daddy Long Legs icon.It should be able to be added into a region's spawns using the name 'ell', 'explosivedll', or 'explosivedaddylonglegs'. If you are for some reason using this mod and Niko's version at the same time, the first name may cause issues, but the last two should be fine.[h2][b]Zappy Daddy Long Legs[/b][/h2]It's quite shocking what this Long Legs can do! Try your best not to get caught off-guard by the electrifying properties of this version of Daddy.Same as the ELL, this can't spawn naturally, ect., ect. While using Arena or Beastmaster, it will have a cyan color to the icon.It should be able to be added into a region's spawns using the name 'zll', 'zapdll', 'zaplonglegs', or 'zapdaddylonglegs'.[h3]Options[/h3]There's now an options config in the remix menu. Right now, it only does things regarding the ZLL mainly because I was worried about small performance issues and the possible unfairness of one of it's abilities, since it could reach you off-screen in a multi-screen room. So I decided to just make it customizable so that everyone can decide for themselves what they want.Have fun with this, and feel free to use it in your own mods if you want, as long this page is referenced somehow!",

This heavy slugcat, with their developed limbs, is exceptional at crawling, climbing, jumping and even throwing. However, they're clumsy at walking, so avoid standing up! They get just as much nutrition as any other slugcat from normal food, but can also eat creatures for a quarter of their regular food pips. Thanks to their fatty tail, they can store food better than most for when resources are scarce. This soft survivalist makes the most with what they have, and can maul. Making meals out of the weak is not their preferred diet, but in the frozen wasteland, it's hard to be picky. Especially when their lizards get hungry.<br><br>2 custom creatures have now been added!

These two creatures are designed to be together!<br><br>[u]KNOWN ISSUES:[/u]<br>- The Friend is missing an ascended portrait.
