How to fix this?<br>A1: Sometimes the mod is not initialized or applied correctly. You can re-apply it in the REMIX menu. Disable and enable the mod, and then press 'APPLY MODS'.<br>A2: One thing that helped multiple people is to delete the 'Rain World/BepInEx' folder and then verifying the integrity of the game files in Steam.<br>A3: Maybe this more extensive strategy works for you:<br>- Delete RW completely.<br>- Then deactivate downpour on steam client so it won't download.<br>- Install RW again.<br>- Apply all mods that you want in remix and test them<br>- Continue if they work now<br>- Activate downpour on steam so it would download<br>- Activate downpour mods in remix<br>- Reboot the game<br><br>Q: The mod doesn't seem to work on SteamDeck. What can I do?<br>A: You can try to add 'WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winhttp=n,b' %command%' to the launch options (in Steam: right click >> Properties >> General). If that doesn't work there are other threads about Linux and SteamDeck on the [url=https://discord.gg/rainworld]Rain World Discord[/url] server.<br><br>Q: The game freezes when entering a region. How to fix this?<br>A: The game might actually not be frozen. The mod needs to generate files for each region. This can take time (>1 minute). Wait a bit. If the game actually crashed then you have an 'exceptionLog.txt' file in your Rain World folder. If that is the case then proceed with the section BUG REPORTS.<br><br>Q: My game actually crashed. What happened?<br>A: Your game might have run out of memory. So far I haven't found a solution to this. As a workaround, I recommend that you restart your game from time to time (see KNOWN ISSUES).<br><br>Q: Some adjacent camera textures don't match visually.<br>A: This is a technical limitation. The camera textures are generated by the game (vanilla) and just stitched together by this mod. This means that the perspective of them don't match. In some cases it is more noticeable than in others.<br><br>[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*]Some snow related shaders don't work correctly. In some places there is more snow than in vanilla and in other places less. Falling snow can 'jump' when you would have changed screens.<br>[*]This mod increases memory consumption. When the game runs low on memory the performance will decline and the game might crash. This might take a while (90+ minutes). Merging room texture can accelerate this. This needs to happen once for every room with multiple screens. The textures are saved to disk (cached) and reused. It is recommended to restart the game every now and then.<br>CONTEXT: There might be memory leaks or memory fragmentation. A memory leak would mean that memory is not released when it is not used anymore. Fragmentation might happen because most roomCamera textures are now fairly large and change in size often. This means that they need to be re-allocated in memory often and they require a chunk of memory without 'holes'.<br>[*]Shadows at the edge of the screen seem to flicker or stretch in some rooms. I can see the same thing without camera scroll. Maybe a vanilla bug.<br>[*]Motion sickness might be a problem. I wonder how much is due to noise (details) in the textures. You can play around with the parameters and see what works for you.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1]SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG[/h1]<br>See the [url=https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll]GitHub page[/url] for this mod.",

Now there's two! The [b]Explosive Long Legs[/b], which was made at the same time as Niko's version, as well as the [b]Zappy Long Legs[/b] are here now. Thanks again, to all the Rain World Ideas people on the Discord! The constant help is, well, helpful.<br><br>[h1][b]Explosive Daddy Long Legs[/b][/h1]<br>This variant of Daddy Long Legs can utilize a hyper-mutation that allows it to create explosions at it's tentacles, in order to stun them and catch prey easier. So, try not to get caught, if you want to live.<br><br>This creature cannot currently spawn in the base game, and you will have to manually spawn it in using the Arena, Beastmaster, or Dev Console. If using Arena or Beastmaster, the icon is a red version of the Daddy Long Legs icon.<br>It should be able to be added into a region's spawns using the name 'ell', 'explosivedll', or 'explosivedaddylonglegs'. If you are for some reason using this mod and Niko's version at the same time, the first name may cause issues, but the last two should be fine.<br><br>[h2][b]Zappy Daddy Long Legs[/b][/h2]<br>It's quite shocking what this Long Legs can do! Try your best not to get caught off-guard by the electrifying properties of this version of Daddy.<br><br>Same as the ELL, this can't spawn naturally, ect., ect.

Right now, it only does things regarding the ZLL mainly because I was worried about small performance issues and the possible unfairness of one of it's abilities, since it could reach you off-screen in a multi-screen room.

Set between the Rivulet and the Saint. These campaigns occur at the same time.<br><br>Friend is the first new character this mod adds. This heavy slugcat, with their developed limbs, is exceptional at crawling, climbing, jumping and even throwing. However, they're clumsy at walking, so avoid standing up!<br><br>Poacher is the second new character of this mod. Their adversaries are far stronger and heavier than this slugcat, who is just a pup, so they must use their intellect and equipment to survive encounters rather than brute force.<br><br>Noir is currently the final character from Solace. Adopted from the mod Noircatto due to code similarity and friendship, he is most mobile on all fours, much like Friend. He can flip and dash around enemies, shredding them with his unique melee attacks. And, to get their attention, he can bait them with a unique vocalization...<br><br>Solace now adds quite a cast of characters, each with their own stories, personalities, and gameplay. As you learn to thrive in the encroaching blizzards, how much of a menace will you become?<br><br>This mod currently adds 3 custom creatures, a custom world state, and significantly decreased food in all regions except for Undergrowth. The custom world state and creatures are a heavy work in progress, and are nowhere near a completed state. However, it seems stable enough to play, so I want people to be able to explore!

Blue button is palette created by you, which is located in OutputPalettes folder. Use yellow button 'New palette' to create a new palette file.<br> [b]SavePalette :[/b] Save the palette in workspace into png file. If its copy from a vanilla palette, this mod will automatically create a new palette and save it as the new palette. Newly created palette need to be save at least once inorder to show up in OutputPalettes folder.<br> Also, some details of current palette will show in a label on the top right. <br><br>[h1]Workspace : [/h1]<br>  Every rect inside workspace represent a pixel in palette texture. Click one to choose it, it will become bigger in size, and definition of current pixel will show in a label on the top left. If the pixel is in a gradient row, the hole row will also become bigger in size. If the pixel is undefined (This means game will not use current pixel as a palette color), the rect will simply not allow you to select it.<br> [b]What is gradient row : [/b]<br>      Gradient row is in order to generate gradient colors easier. Every rect in row that has a gradient label will show a small dot opon it. That means other rects which dont have label will use it as a source color to generate their own colors. Color of no label rect will lerp from the first labeled rect on the left to the first labeld rect on the right. First and last rect in row will always be labeled.<br><br>[h1]ColorPicker : [/h1]<br>   [b]ColorTape [/b] is used to select hue of picked color, rect below is used to select value and saturation. (Just a HSV color you know)<br>    A small rect on the right of tape is used to show current picked color.<br> [b]SetCol :[/b] Set the color of current selected rect in workspace to picked color. If current rect is in row and not labeled, a label will be added.<br>  [b]RemoveLabel : [/b] Remove label of selected rect if it is labeled. <br>  [b]Pick Color : [/b] Click this to pick a color on screen of current mouse position.<br><br>[h1]More infos: [/h1]<br>   Github : https://github.com/pkuyo/PaletteCreator<br>    [b]After finish creating a new palette, you need to move it to Palettes folder in your own mod folder in order to use it.

"desc": "[ HAVE REMIX MENU NOW! ]<br>[ Requires DLC, otherwise it may cause the game to crash. ]<br><br>[Introduction]<br>The Outsider is an overly flashy slugcat, or rather a distant relative of the slugcat. It possesses the genes of winged insects, which allows it to obtain biological fluorescence and flight ability, but also makes the Spore Puffs fatal to it.<br><br>1. The Outsider can fly. When in the air, hold down the jump button to flap your wings. The first flap of wings after each liftoff does not consume food points, but each subsequent flap will consume 1/4 of food points.<br>2. The Outsider can flare. When standing on the ground, holding down both the pick and jump buttons will consume 1 food point to release a flare.<br>3. The Outsider is a vegetarian animal. It cannot consume any meat, but as compensation, it can swallow more types of plants to obtain satiety, such as Bubble Weed, Flashbang, etc. But Spore Puffs is POISONOUS, and consuming it will immediately cause the outsider to die. Please don't blame it, there are no Spore Puffs in The Outsider's hometown, and The Outsider, like you, didn't know this at first.<br><br>I hope you will find these abilities useful... because it has to try to survive in a dark and gloomy world.<br><br>[Known issues]<br>Sometimes Jolly Coop will replace the character controlled by the player with a survivor. You only need to switch back to the outsider in the Jolly Coop.<br><br>[Notes]<br>I used a translator to write this introduction, so there may be some descriptions that are incorrect.<br>You can customize its color in the JOLLY CO-OP. I made some modifications to the world map, and also modified the generation of creatures in each region to align them with the current timeline. But there are currently no new endings.<br>There are almost no new storylines. I am also considering the issue of balance, please don't worry.<br><br>[Other]<br>Special thanks to Harvie and Pkuyo for their help and advice. This is the first mod I wrote, so there may be many bugs that I haven't discovered yet. If you find it, please let me know. Apologize in advance for any possible bugs, hope you enjoy it!<br>Additionally, I initially only wanted to play my own OC in the game, so I created this mod. Just to fit my OC timeline, I modified the world. So perhaps it won't achieve the completion level of the campaign in the game, please don't have too high expectations for it.<br>Due to Steam restrictions, I am unable to reply to comments. I am very sorry for this.<br>If you wish to create a video for this mod, you do not need my consent.<br><br>[Bug fix]<br>1. Fixed a problem where entering a room with five pebbles caused the game to crash.<br>2. Removed the description of 'timeline' from the file, I hope this will not cause mod to fail to start again because it cannot be found.<br>3. Fixed the bug where 'Game Over' was not displayed after being killed by Smoke Fruit.<br>4. Fixed the bug where sliding down the pipeline would start flying.<br>5. Fixed the issue of rain in the Karma Gate room in areas without rain<br>6. Fixed issue where other characters cannot jump due to fixing other bugs<br>7. Fixed issues with the generation of creatures. But the old save flies of The Outsider must be deleted (restart the campaign) in order for the loaded area to properly spawn creatures. <br>8. Fixed issue where using this slugcat to enter arena mode would crash.<br>9. Solved the problem of multiple cats being unable to fly correctly and consuming food points in the presence<br>10. Achieved compatibility with Rotund World. But you know, a bird that is too fat cannot fly : )<br>11. Resolved the conflict with Spore Cat.<br>12. Solved the problem of going to a room near Moon that caused the game to crash.<br>13. Fixed the issue of not being able to grasp the pole during flight using the new animation.<br>14. Fixed the issue of multiple outsiders' antennae not displaying properly after updating the animation, and solved the problem of outsiders' flying affecting each other.<br>15. Fixed issues with SL echo not appearing and SB echo appearing in cycle 0.<br>16. Fixed issues with missing swallowtail and jagged swallowtail.<br>17. Fixed the issue of unable to land due to flying in the last room before entering the outro process.<br>18. Fixed the issue of non integer food points consumed during flight cannot be displayed properly.<br>19. Fixed the issue of outsider cannot fly with multiple players in a session.<br>20. Fixed the issue of remix menu's 'hide swallow tail' option does not work.<br><br>If you still encounter the above issues, you can try subscribing to this mod again, as the workshop may not update in a timely manner in the game. If it still doesn't work, please let me know. Thank you.",

Feast thoroughly, despite any difficulties you may face in defeating your foes.<br>Their strong rock throws will let you numb creatures and reduce them to easier pickings. Many beasts are stronger than one may think however, so make sure to stay sharp in case they reawaken after mauling.<br>Now, the most important change, forcing the new gameplay style: <br>[b]You cannot throw spears.[/b] At all, which may cause some difficulties in combat and traversal...<br><br>[h1] Features [/h1] <br>This Owl-Approved mod contains:<br>[list]<br>[*] A new sub-region with wonderfully crafted new screens in Industrial Complex from myself and other region makers like Oscarriaq. (You can get a taste of them in the image showcase.)<br>[*] Minor edits to the world.<br>[*] A new custom Glorious, Strong, Gorgeous slugcat with a way of life that will take a short moment to understand.<br>[*] Some new funky arenas and challenges!<br>[*] And more.<br>[*] A broken Industrial Complex map, but we ignore this part.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1] Dependencies and Important Things. [/h1] <br><br>[b]- Requires the Downpour DLC and Slugbase mod to function.[/b]<br>[b]- Requires Dress my Slugcat for the custom sprites, not required but suggested to use.[/b]<br>The mod should set the skin to The Savage's default automatically, but if there are no custom sprites, you can set them yourself in the 'Get Fancy' button the Dress my Slugcat mod adds to the main menu.<br>[b]- I would recommend disabling Emerald's Tweaks and Sain't whilst playing as there appears to be a few issues in relation to these mods. ...I wouldn't expect fixes to these issues anytime soon with my coding skills.[/b]<br><br>[h1] Credits and Thankyou's [/h1] <br>[list]<br>[*]Thankyou Lumi (o645 on discord) and the rest of the modding-dev discord for doing most of the complex coding work - Spear throwing and longer rock stuns to be exact!<br>[*]Emir™ for help with the mod thumbnail, memes and story menu slugcat art :]<br>[*]Oscar the lizor and Ceglon the brick sir (and myself, too) for play testing of both singleplayer and co-op.<br>[*]And congratulations to me (the owl gamer) 🦉 for actually releasing a mod!!<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1] Other Important Details [/h1] <br>[list]<br>[*]The mod has no cutscenes for the moment, nor any Iterator dialogue, however you may expect some soon.<br>[*]As mentioned earlier, Emerald Tweaks and Sain't may cause issues, most by me, some from them.<br>[/list]<br><br>...<br>Oh yeah, and thanks to you, fellow Rainworld Enjoyer!

This could cause long jumps to feel weird, and for his eyes to look a bit wonky(But when aren't they?).<br><br>Globox and Rayman skins use their head sprite for their chest pattern.

In the Room Rando's Remix interface, there is a Regions tab.

That is just where they would live if I could mod it in.<br>(This mod is compatible with creature randomizer.)<br><br>[hr][/hr]<br>[h1] Lizor [/h1](Time: all but Rivulet and Saint, Found everywhere.)<br>Tiny, cute and innocent lizard children who eat batflies and various other bugs. Unsurprisingly, they are easy to tame since you can just throw a ton of batflies for them to eat. They are attacked by most other lizards, however, so you have to keep them safe.<br><br>[h1] Volt Lizard [/h1](Time: Survivor to Rivulet, Found in the Recursive Transform Arrays and [spoiler]Linear Systems Rail[/spoiler].)<br>As a result of constant shocking, these lizards have evolved a slight resistance to electricity and have also incorporated it into their own bodies. Whenever they try to bite, they release an slight shock that arcs between their teeth (in game this is shown as a one shot to most slugcats). As a side effect of the electricity, they are very energetic and are very fast.<br><br>[h1] Magenta Lizards [/h1](Time: Rivulet, Found anywhere with pink lizards. Can also be found in outer expanse in gourmand.)<br>Due to evolutionary pressure, some pink lizards have evolved into magenta lizards. These lizards are slightly stronger, faster and can see farther. Due to the dark coloration of the environment, they have evolved a much darker colo(u)ration. <br><br>[h1] Tangerine Lizards [/h1](Time: Spearmaster, Rivulet and Saint, Found in the Sky Islands and the Exterior)<br>A truly interesting lizard, the tangerine lizard exists as both a crossbreed between cyan and orange lizards and the ancestor of the two. Tangerine lizards hunt in packs of 5-10, dashing and surrounding their prey quickly, before taking turns going into the fray. One coming in each time you'd least want one.<br><br>[h1] Chameleon Lizard [/h1](Time: Gourmand, Found in the Outer Expanse.)<br>A disguised, tough lizard with a very slow metabolism. They will disguise on the floor, and wait for prey to step on them or near their head. They can go for very long without any food due to their metabolism. They will take more than a few spears to take down this lizard!<br><br>[h1] Sky Blue Lizard [/h1](Time: Rivulet, Found in Sky Islands and Industrial Complex.)<br>A evolution of blue lizards which have evolved gas propulsion in their tails due to dormant cyan genes. In addition they have quite a long tail and fast reflexes. They are quite a magnificent sight to behold!<br><br>[h1] Cherry Lizard [/h1](Time: Saint, Found in Silent Construct.)<br>An evolution of the strawberry lizards. They have inherited antennae due to orange heritage, and they hunt in groups. As a result of their slightly tinier, more rotund bodies, they can move very fast with their tongues. Due to all of this, they can surround prey quick and quickly attack those who harm the pack.<br><br>[h1] Raspberry Lizard [/h1](Time: Saint, Found in Silent Construct.)<br>A crossbreed between a red lizard and a strawberry lizard. They are quick, agile and have stronger tongues that can propel their bodies. They are much smarter and try to steal the spears of prey while also trying to corner them. They have some of the strength of the red lizard, making a deadly combination.<br><br>[h1] The End? [/h1]<br>For now this is all. There will be many more lizards to come.  <br>",

There are a number of limitations & bugs. Use at your own risk.[/h3]<br><br>[h3]Description[/h3]<br>A mod that adds Pokéballs. When a creature is hit with one, there's a chance it can be captured. When a ball hits a wall or other creature, the contained creature will release. Pokéballs have a 60% chance of spawning in scavenger treasuries. If a Pokéball spawns, theres a 20% chance for it to become a Greatball (increased capture chance), and a 1% chance for a Masterball (100% capture chance). Also watch out for scavengers, as they are expert Pokémon trainers (and will catch you). <br><br>Pokéballs will only tame creatures that are already tamable. <br>Needs Fisobs to work. Has an options menu. Also source code included for those who like spaghetti. <br>Spawn with Dev Console using 'spawn_raw Pokéballs.PokeballAbstract Greatball' or other types. <br><br>© Pokemon Pokeball belongs to Nintendo / Gamefreak / The Pokémon Company <br><br>[h3]Possibly in the future?[/h3]<br>- Break Pokéball if capture failed. <br>- Trading rare creatures with Scavengers to get higher reputation. <br>- More color/types of Pokéballs with different capture chances & features. <br>- Crafting Pokéballs as Gourmand? <br>- Pokémon battles with scavengers. Pokémon battle events? Free toll passthrough if player wins. <br>- Tame all creatures. (probably not because i think this is way too complex) <br>- Better Jolly Co-op support if possible. <br><br>[h3]Known bugs/issues[/h3]<br>- Slugpup relationships are removed entirely if they are kept in a Pokéball for too long, or during hibernation. Their food pips will first blink and later disappear. Release slugpups in shelters, or you need to get to know each other again as if you met for the first time. <br>- Creature relationships (if available) are not stored, instead they are reset to fully friendly. <br>- Releasing Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. <br>- Pokéball doesn't like rolling up slopes. It gets stuck on edges. <br>- If you time it right and throw a Pokéball at a DLL while it's eating, creatures can get stuck to DLLs in a unknown state upon release. <br>- Pokéball button light sometimes misaligned when carried. <br>- An exception might occur if a Pokéball hits certain projectiles mid-air (spitter spider dart). But this shouldn't cause problems afaik. <br>- BeastMaster can't spawn Pokéballs, use mod keybind option for now. The same applies to Centipede Shields, so it should be either a Fisobs or BeastMaster bug. <br>- Using Warp Menu will often change >something?< that will make you throw Pokéballs against yourself. <br>- Captured creatures in arena cannot be recovered if Pokéball is unloaded and re-added to the room, this is unfixable afaik. <br><br>[h3]Player bugs/issues[/h3]<br>- Make sure players are not stuck in Pokéballs when hibernating, because that is counted as a player death. Restoring players after hibernating is undefined behavior. <br>- Getting carried into a den when you're inside a Pokéball won't trigger a death. You will need to manually restart. <br>- If you're stored in a Pokéball, and a scavenger carries you to a gate, the gate will actually activate, but the game will freeze. <br>- Pokéball camera tracking if player is stored is unreliable and doesn't work correctly with multi screen rooms. <br><br>[h3]Reporting[/h3]<br>Please report any bug, problem, change or feature request via the Discussions, or message me on the Rain World Discord (https://discord.gg/rainworld): Maxi Mol#3079 <br>If reporting a problem, also include the steps to recreate it & the following file(s): <br>- 'exceptionLog.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/exceptionLog.txt) <br>- 'LogOutput.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt) <br>",

The semi-plant cell structure allows it to perform photosynthesis in the wild, use the mimic tail to attract bat flies, and camouflage.<br><br>【Ability】<br>+ Photosynthesis: Staying in open-air areas in the wild can slowly restore satiety through photosynthesis.<br>+ Prey Attraction: Bat flies will be attracted and actively approach.<br>+ Mimic camouflage: When lying down or crawling forward, it will enter a hidden state, which is not easy to be found by predators in this state.<br>+ Karma protection: In the state of full food, long press ↑ + pick up button can consume all food to get a karma level protection.<br>+ Very cute: Similar is an unbelievably cute slugcat and suitable for everyone!!<br><br>【Other】<br>Similar was born on Sky Island and has weaker physical fitness. The timeline and environment of its current life are similar to those of Monk.<br>Mod will continue to be updated in the future, and Similar may have more new mechanisms, plots and more original content.<br>Thank you for your love and support for this mod, and welcome your comments and feedback.<br><br>【Known issues】<br>1. Please do not use DMS (pinch cat) to replace textures for Similar, which will cause conflicts<br>2. Conflict with the SunHat MOD will cause the head map to display abnormally. If you mind, you can play as a slugpup or consider disabling the SunHat MOD<br><br>【Update log】<br>16/7<br>1. New ability: eating karma flower can directly increase the level of karma under the condition of existing karma protection (you can choose to enable/disable on the configuration page)<br>2. New mechanism: the attack in the camouflage state will remove the camouflage (you can choose to enable/disable on the configuration page)<br>3. New configuration items: Now players can adjust the intensity of the camouflage ability by yourself<br>4. Fixed some problems in multiplayer online situations<br>——————————————————————<br>24/5<br>1. Photosynthesis is now compatible with Rotund World<br>2. Other slugcats will not mistakenly use the karma protection ability<br>3. Fixed the problem that the game could not be loaded due to the straw hat MOD replacing the texture<br><br>【Author's words】<br>From Cotton:<br>Ah, I finally got to this point... It's really hard for me. I'm just a trainee who just started learning programming and C# language for two and a half months. This is the first mod I try to make. Many functions are group The teachers helped to realize it (the mod code is a mess, please don’t read that .jpg), but I am very happy to think that the cute cat of CarbonTea is finally made! It's really cute (let me eat first.jpg)<br>Finally, I hope everyone can like this mod. If you have better suggestions or changes, I will consider it when I have a higher level of programming (no.jpg)<br>If there is a bug (hope there will be less x), please try to bring the exceptionLog file in the root directory of the Rain World game, thank you!<br><br>From Carbontea:<br>Similar was originally the original slug cat oc I designed in 2018.<br>Similar is inspired by the red grass that can attract bat flies in the game, the mimic pole and some plants that hunt insects in reality. Because Rain World gives people the impression of danger, so I let this slug cat evolve the ability of mimicry and camouflage, and the semi-vegetative structure allows it to acquire the characteristics of photosynthesis and attracting bats.<br>I am very grateful to Teacher Xue Mian for making this design a reality after 5 years! I hope everyone likes Similar, anyway, I already like it to death.",

However, this can leave them vulnerable to a counterattack.<br><br>[*][b]Artillery Lizard (RED_PINK)[/b]: Artillery Lizards were created as a purposed organism designed to curb creature counts. They are both heavily armoured and highly stun resistant, with the ability to distil fire powder bombs from within their own stomach.<br><br>[*][b]Blueberry Lizard (LIGHT_BLUE)[/b]: A lizard known to slugcats, originating from beyond the facility grounds. Blueberry lizards are passive towards slug cats, but are laughably weak and possess the ability to spit swallowed debris when in danger.<br><br>[*][b]Corpse Lizard (GREY)[/b]: Corpses reanimated by vast hordes of spiders, these bodies hunt to feed the hive inside them.<br><br>[*][b]Cicada Lizard (SQUIDCADA)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Dragon Lizard (HOT_PINK)[/b]: As a creature originating from the depths below the world, Dragon Lizards possess some dangerous traits. They can use void fluid stored in their stomach to fire a volley of firebug eggs each cycle, and are capable of propelling themselves through the air.<br><br>[*][b]Gator Lizard (SEAWEED)[/b]: A coastal variant of the green lizard, gators have stronger muscles and less weight, allowing them to climb poles and dive beneath the waves.<br><br>[*][b]Hive Lizard (RED_ORANGE)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Nightmare Lizard (PITCH_BLACK)[/b]: A lethal underwater predator, Nightmare lizards have adapted to the murky depths and only rely on touch and sound alone to navigate. Their lethal bite, acute hearing and the upper hand in the water should not be underestimated. [b]Oh yeah, and it's almost unkillable.[/b]<br><br>[*][b]Infant Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: An infant lizard known for its extreme aggression. They don't survive very long away from their mother.<br><br>[*][b]Mature Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: A slow-moving predator, capable of storing its young inside a pocket concealed within its mouth, not unlike a crocodile. It weaponises its children as a means to catch prey.<br><br>[*][b]Spitter Lizard (DARK_RED)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Spore Lizard (WHITE_GREEN)[/b]: A variant of lizard, overtaken by fungal spores. It has gained the ability to spit hardened pellets that explode in gas clouds, multiple times on impact. They tend to prey on insects, and will flee from any other creature it perceives as a threat.<br><br>[*][b]Fire Lizard (ORANGE)[/b]: With a diet of firebugs, fire lizards are a dangerous predator, being able to expel fire spears at an alarming rate.<br><br>[*][b]Infested Lizard (BROWN)[/b]: Victims of contaminated water in the vast wastes below Five Pebbles, Infested lizards are nothing more than hosts.<br>[/list]<br><br><br>[i]This is my first actual mod, so feedback is very much appreciated! <3[/i]",

I'd love to hear what you guys think of this little passion project of mine. Also the skins might look goofy in specific poses, but it's bound to happen to anything more complex than a single color silhouette.<br><br>- Toggle asymmetry for every fancy tail texture. Recommended tail length about 6-8. Rivulet's tail looks best slimmer.<br><br>- Arti and Riv do not use extras (gills, scar).<br><br>- Spearmaster's grayscale skin shares the same face sprites as their colorful counterpart. Which means you have to set the face the same color as your body color. It's the way it is due to SM's long head, and most face sprites don't sit right on it in certain angles. I will change every skin accordingly once DMS layer function comes to existence.<br><br>- [strike]The rest of the slugcats will definitely come before the end of this summer.

He was a mischievous and artistic slugcat who had a knack for graffiti, and was inspired by the music he listen to from his RainPods(tm). Every wall, pipe, and surface in his vicinity became his canvas, as he painted vibrant murals that brought color to the gloomy world.<br><br>However, The Vinki's life took a sad turn when he encountered Five Pebbles, a notorious and eccentric iterator known for his strict adherence to rules. It was an unfortunate meeting that forever changed The Vinki's perception of the world. Five Pebbles, in his unyielding quest for order, found one of The Vinki's graffiti pieces and decided to erase it with a single stroke of his overseer's laser.<br><br>The Vinki was devastated. His masterpiece was gone, reduced to mere dust. The pain of betrayal seeped deep into his slugcat soul. But he was determined to turn his sadness into something extraordinary.<br><br>As he wandered through the ruins and remnants of the Rain World, The Vinki stumbled upon a hidden alcove. Within it lay a forgotten artifact known as Soap shoes. These shoes were unlike anything he had ever seen before. They were infused with a long-lost technology that allowed the wearer to effortlessly grind rails and poles.<br><br>The Vinki saw this as a sign—a chance to not only express himself through art but to also seek vengeance in a playful yet hilarious manner. With his newfound grinding abilities, he set out to create his most audacious and eye-catching graffiti pieces yet, leaving them in the most daring and impossible-to-reach places.<br><br>From the tops of crumbling skyscrapers to the edges of perilous cliffs, The Vinki's art became a symbol of rebellion and resilience. He painted with passion, pouring his heart and soul into each stroke, defying the oppressive world around him.<br><br>The Rain World denizens, initially puzzled by The Vinki's antics, couldn't help but be both amused and awestruck. They laughed at the absurdity of seeing a slugcat grinding rails and poles, creating intricate art high above their heads. The Vinki's graffiti became a beacon of hope, reminding them that even in the darkest of times, there was still room for joy and laughter.<br><br>And so, The Vinki, the sad yet funny slugcat, continued to roam the Rain World, leaving his mark wherever he could. He carried the pain of betrayal, but he channeled it into his art, inspiring others to find solace in their own creativity. The Vinki's saga taught the denizens of Rain World that even amidst sorrow, a little laughter and self-expression could bring about profound healing and transformation.<br><br>[b][url=https://artfight.net/character/3448140.the-vinki-slugcat]Artfight link[/url][/b] <br><br>[h1]To Do[/h1]<br>[list]<br>    [*][strike]Grind in 0G[/strike]<br>    [*][strike]Grind on vines[/strike]<br>    [*][strike]Graffiti placement mechanic[/strike]<br>    [*]Graffiti Quest<br>    [*]Story<br>    [list]<br>        [*][strike]Intro Scene[/strike]<br>        [*][strike]Graffiti Tutorial[/strike]<br>        [*][strike]Grinding Tutorial[/strike]<br>        [*][strike]LttM[/strike]<br>        [*]Midway Scene<br>        [*]Climax Scenario<br>    [/list]<br>    [*]World design changes<br>    [list]<br>        [*][strike]Graffiti Tutorial[/strike]<br>        [*]More grind rails in vanilla regions<br>        [*]New(ish) region<br>    [/list]<br>    [*]Art<br>    [list]<br>        [*][strike]Character Select[/strike]<br>        [*][strike]Sleeping[/strike]<br>        [*][strike]Multiplayer Icons[/strike]<br>        [*]Quest Screen<br>        [*]Quest Graffiti<br>        [*]Acension Ending<br>        [*]New Ending<br>    [/list]<br>    [*]Music<br>    [list]<br>        [*][strike]Tutorial[/strike]<br>        [*][strike]'Vertical Grinding'[/strike]<br>        [*]TBD<br>    [/list]<br>    [*]Custom animations<br>    [list]<br>        [*][strike]Crafting[/strike]<br>        [*][strike]Vertical Grinding[/strike]<br>    [/list]<br>    [*]Trailer<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1]Credits [/h1][h2]Check the Remix menu for full credits + graffiti credits[/h2]<br>[list]<br>[*]The legendary [i]cone._.lord[/i] (on Discord) for the Art!<br>[*]The brilliant Asagi Ars ([i]MaxDubstep[/i] on Discord) for the original music!<br>[*]The very-based Tarnished Potato ([i]tarnpot[/i] on Discord) for his level design and for implementing his mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2999289203&searchtext=Fortunate+Development]Fortunate Development[/url], into this mod!<br>[*]My lovely gf for the name idea and help with the original color choices! <3<br>[*]The teams behind the mod's dependencies and the awesome people on the RW Discord for making modding Rain World as painless and as fun of a process as possible!<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1]Known Mod Conflicts[/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*][strike][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2957745837]What's In My Pocket[/url][/strike] (should be fixed now)<br>[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035427908]Cosmospectre[/url]<br>[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3089929720]Deserted Wastelands[/url] (causes tutorial music to not trigger)<br>[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2979857064]Deadlands[/url] (for easter egg reasons)<br>[/list]<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!

Since the mod doesn't have any mechanic dependencies from Downpour yet, it is theoretically possible to play it with the base game. Though I highly recommend against this as it will probably only cause the mod to break later on once abilities such as crafting are added.",

Includes options to pause, destroy, duplicate, tame, stun, teleport, safari-control, kill & revive individual creatures, players and objects. Also allows you to activate and throw items like bombs and spears. <br>Press right mouse button on an object or the background to open one of two radial menus. Hold left control (default) to only select or drag creatures, and left alt (default) for objects. <br>If you want to play multiplayer safari, you need to drag or select a player and then enable control over a creature. If there's no player to drag (safari mode) you can use Dev Console to run the following command to assign new safari-inputs to a specific player: 'invoke MouseDrag.Drag.SetPlayerNr 0' <br><br>Credits:<br>- Fyre & Noir for the BeastMaster menu trianglemesh code <br>- IdleFire Guardian for playtesting <br><br>Source code is here: https://github.com/woutkolkman/mousedrag <br><br>[h3]Known issues/bugs[/h3]<br>- Pausing a deer while you're on it will make you slide off. You need to jump to be able to move again. <br>- When cut/pasting a player in/to arena, if there's a creature in their stomach (Hazer), it is deleted. This happens because of limitations when deserializing a creature. <br>- When cut/pasting objects, many objects will ignore the new position and spawn back on their old position in a new room. This is determined by how the object is programmed. <br>- Cut/pasting Oracles (iterator puppets) has a VERY HIGH chance of crashing the game. Also, their sprites will not be removed immediately. <br>- Pasting Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. <br>- If Jolly Co-op is enabled, the camera won't follow a safari-controlled slugpup. <br>- If returning form a safari-controlled creature, if the player room was reloaded, you cannot open your map. Jolly Co-op will keep the player's room loaded and prevent this from happening. <br><br>[h3]Reporting[/h3]<br>Please report any bug, problem, change or feature request via the Discussions, or message me on the Rain World Discord (https://discord.gg/rainworld): Maxi Mol#3079 <br>If reporting a problem, also include the steps to recreate it & the following file(s): <br>- 'exceptionLog.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/exceptionLog.txt) <br>- 'LogOutput.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt) <br>",

Having the old mod taken down gave those affected time to heal. Your patience in waiting for this mod's remake has been very appreciated! <br>[b]What is the goal in this campaign?[/b]<br>At the moment of release, nothing! Just have fun!<br>[b]What's planned for the mod?[/b]<br>Plans for future updates include unique winged slugcats for the Hunter and Monk campaign with different flight speeds as well as unique pearls for all three campaigns, which will have some lore!<br>[b]Are Cherub Lizards back?[/b]<br>Sadly, no. None of the old code is reused, and our team is not capable of coding them back in. There's a chance they might return in a future update!<br>[b]How can I customize the wings?[/b]<br>Wingcat's wings are comprised of hand animated sprites separated into one asset file with three unique segments, of which are the wing top, top feathers and bottom feathers. This allows all three assets to be colored uniquely, however only one needs to actually have sprites to work. (The others can just be left blank!)<br>[b]Is fanart okay?[/b]<br>Absolutely! Just please do not draw depictions of Wingcat in romantic contexts. <br><br>[h1]KNOWN BUGS:[/h1]<br>Remix menu options might break depending on which other mods are enabled.<br>White outline on the sleep screen, will be patched soon!<br>DMS scrolling issues - this is not something we can fix on our end, sorry! You'll have to change custom colors through the character menu.<br>There is no OE cutscene (yet), sorry for the confusion in the OG description! It's just a unique save screen post-completion for now!<br><br>[h1] CREDITS: [/h1] <br>All campaign art, wing animation, Wingcat's design: Faeling<br>Coding and bringing this mod back to life: MusicalMiracle (Check out their other mods!)",

Currently, there is no plot-related content, including Five Pebbles (FP) and Moon dialogues, endings, etc., but the functionality is mostly complete.[/h2]<br><br>[h1]Plot Introduction:[/h1]<br>You are a cosmic ghost possessing cosmic energy. For unknown reasons, you have fallen from the cosmic space onto this planet, where the Rain World is unfolding, temporarily losing most of your cosmic abilities. You need to visit the echoes of the ancestors and collect fragments of stars to regain your lost abilities and find a way back to the universe.<br><br>[h1]Features:[/h1]<br>[b]The cosmic ghost has the ability to create cosmic items and manipulate time and space.[/b]<br>[b]All skills have related settings in the mod config interface[/b]<br><br>[h2]Starting Abilities:[/h2]<br>[h3]1. Starrealm Spear Crafting:[/h3] Spend 1 hunger to convert any spear into a Starrealm Spear using cosmic energy. The Starrealm Spear can instantly kill any creature it hits and reverts to a normal spear after use.<br>[h3]2. Singularity Bomb Crafting:[/h3] Spend 2 hunger to combine two rocks into a Singularity Bomb using cosmic energy. The user is immune to the effects of the Singularity Bomb.<br>[h3]3. Ghost Form:[/h3] In situations with zero gravity, the character transforms into a semi-transparent ghost form, immune to the influence of any creatures or the environment.<br><br>[h2]Abilities to Restore:[/h2]<br>[h3]1. Gravity Control:[/h3] Unlocked upon when you saw five pebbles, it allows you to spend 1 hunger to change the gravity in the current room for 30 seconds. If you change rooms, the new room will also be affected.<br>[h3]2. Time Freeze:[/h3] Unlocked when reaching the maximum Gravitational Force limit. Activating this ability immobilizes all creatures except for yourself for approximately 6 seconds, with a cooldown of 45 seconds.<br>[h3]3. Space Teleportation:[/h3] A new element involving the collection of Star Fragments, similar in appearance to sandbox collectibles. After collecting one in each area, you unlock the ability to set teleportation gates in the current area. These gates allow you to teleport between areas with a cooldown of 30 seconds and a 6-second activation delay, during which you can be interrupted by other creatures.<br>[h3]4. Time Reversal:[/h3] Unlocked after collecting all Star Fragments in every area. When activated, time starts to reverse, and the states of objects and creatures revert to previous conditions. This can be triggered after death and can be used multiple times in one cycle, depending on the current Gravitational Force level.<br>[h3]5. Space-Time Travel:[/h3] ???

I hope you enjoy this mod as much as I did making it, let me know if there are any problems or incompatibies!<br><br>Some notes:<br><br>They can be spawned in both arena mode and beastmaster, the red icon spawns in a two headed outspector, but the blue icon spawns in a one headed outspector<br><br>Outspectors will attack nearly anything that is unfortunate enough to cross their resident super structure! Including lizards, slugcats, and even other outspectors*, strangely enough, it seems that one of the few creatures they won't attack are regular inspectors, even when they're actively attacking them, I wonder why that is...<br><br>Unlike normal inspectors, once all heads are incapacitated and the outspector is effectively 'dead', outspectors will not immediately explode upon death, another odd side effect of their defective nature, under most circumstances, they'll require a LOT of spearhits, and I mean a lot...<br><br>*Due to limitations with Fisobs, outspectors do not attack other outspectors with the same headcount, however, one headed outspectors will attack two headed outspectors and vice versa, perhaps another quirk of their faulty nature, they're occasionally unable to recognize when one inspector is faulty or not!<br><br>Huge thank you to the following people for helping me along the way!<br><br>GreatestGrasshopper (for helping me get the fisobs code to initiate)<br><br>Alphahappy<br><br>Eli (for helping me figure out spawns)<br><br><br>StormTheCat<br><br>And pretty much everyone in both the raincord modding channels and the modding discord for helping me with my struggles every step along the way, you rock!<br><br><br>(You're allowed to use and modify the code for this mod for anything, just credit me!

(note: the longer they are a scug the more they forget about this previous life).<br><br>(Regular part)<br>After her new slugcat family was killed while her body was still in childhood, she was adopted by scavengers for some time before eventually being sent to live with the first responsible slugcats they found.<br><br>Her first relationship went well, and she was gifted her bracelet from her lover, and all was well until her lover ended her own life. She decided to travel to avoid the bad memories, eventually finding another slugcat colony, where she met a new partner, this one male, and they became life mates, her partner gifting her the purple pearl necklace.<br><br>They had four children: a boy, a pair of twin boy and girl, and finally a girl. Her youngest child, disabled from birth, wore a red scarf. She eventually got so focused caring for everyone else that she ended up accidentally neglecting her eldest, who then disappeared to tame a huge number of lizards. She left a note in his room apologising and asking to make amends.<br><br>One day, she went hunting for the colony's food, only to find the entire colony killed at the hands of lizards - controlled by her scorned eldest son. As she walked back into the colony, she saw the remains of her youngest, and took her scarf to wear in her memory. Every step over the corpses of family and friends felt like walking on blades. She decided that the only way to curb her son's rage would be to silence him herself.<br><br>She saw him reading the note, a pained expression on his face, then he looked up to her, as she was standing over him with a menacing aura. During their ensuing battle, she gained what would become many of her scars, and the rare acid-spitting lizards her son had in his pack were able to sear her right eye off with acid...<br><br>...but in doing so, she manifested the power to create a Soul Harpoon.<br>She used her new weapon, forged from the souls of her loved ones she had now realised she had absorbed, to slay the lizards and her son, and decided that the only way to spare herself of this pain would be to give up on relationships entirely. Along this path, she developed a hatred and hunger for lizards. (note: this hatred is not as severe as Artificer's hatred of scavs).<br><br>The scavengers around her gave their utmost respect, branding the mark of the Dragon Slayer into her arms as a ceremonial status symbol. She would later find a lost slugpup, adopting it for her own, but was unable to save them when they ran towards scavengers curiously... with a spear in their hands. The scavengers immediately regretted striking the pup down when they saw her, though she refused to kill them despite her hurt and their offers to die in retribution, as she understood why. A pack of lizards appearing left her with only one option for escape - throwing her child's corpse as an edible distraction.<br><br>She blames herself for everything.<br><br>and there yah gooo!!<br><br>BUT PLEASE SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS AND PEOPLE WHO MADE THE ART SHOWCASED IN THE MOD!

However, that doesn't mean you need to reset your run to see high ID creatures. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you to stormthecat (lights out) and Alduris (ID finder) for teaching me how to hook for this mod!

Also, his tail should be full width and a legnth of 5.), but you should change The Mark to the skin color pertaining to the respective skin as I didnt mess with any of that. <br><br>Credits: <br>IteratorWalk  <br>Lizardcat  <br><br>Think Ring and Drag Mod NOT INCLUDED.",

"author": "Croken85",
"desc": "This mod adds two new lizards (Fanged Lizard and Great Fanged Lizard) inspired by the great Girros and Girros from Monster Hunter.<br>This breed of social lizards have mastered the paralyzing venom that they can inject into their prey through their disproportionate fangs to make it difficult for them to fight back once they have been bitten. Despite this, fanged lizards are quite cowardly, running or evading any creature that exceeds them in size even if they are in a pack.<br>However, everything changes when they have a Great fanged lizard with them, being the equivalent of the alpha male of the specie, despite being slower and stupider than their small counterpart, It makes up for it with a greater ferocity, resistance and a much more powerful paralyzing venom that allows it to confront even vultures, they have also learned to infuse their saliva with their venom, so be very careful.<br>Right now they don't appear naturally so I recommend using the Modded Unlocks or BeastMaster mod to use them, I also have to tell you that this is my first time creating a mod with Fisobs so it may have compatibility problems.<br>If anyone wants to put them in a custom region, don't be shy about asking me.<br>I hope you like them!",
