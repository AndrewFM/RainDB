Experiment and find out what has the best effect out of all the items ((yes plants such as karma flowers and bubble weed count and can ricochet weapons)).<br><br>May be a bit hard to get used to at first but it's very rewarding I think<br><br>There's also a mechanic of throwing a bomb at a non-weapon item effectively turning that item into a ricochetable target but it's uses are limited at best, so good luck pulling that off.",

How to fix this?<br>A1: Sometimes the mod is not initialized or applied correctly. You can re-apply it in the REMIX menu. Disable and enable the mod, and then press 'APPLY MODS'.<br>A2: One thing that helped multiple people is to delete the 'Rain World/BepInEx' folder and then verifying the integrity of the game files in Steam.<br>A3: Maybe this more extensive strategy works for you:<br>- Delete RW completely.<br>- Then deactivate downpour on steam client so it won't download.<br>- Install RW again.<br>- Apply all mods that you want in remix and test them<br>- Continue if they work now<br>- Activate downpour on steam so it would download<br>- Activate downpour mods in remix<br>- Reboot the game<br><br>Q: The mod doesn't seem to work on SteamDeck. What can I do?<br>A: You can try to add 'WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winhttp=n,b' %command%' to the launch options (in Steam: right click >> Properties >> General). If that doesn't work there are other threads about Linux and SteamDeck on the [url=https://discord.gg/rainworld]Rain World Discord[/url] server.<br><br>Q: The game freezes when entering a region. How to fix this?<br>A: The game might actually not be frozen. The mod needs to generate files for each region. This can take time (>1 minute). Wait a bit. If the game actually crashed then you have an 'exceptionLog.txt' file in your Rain World folder. If that is the case then proceed with the section BUG REPORTS.<br><br>Q: My game actually crashed. What happened?<br>A: Your game might have run out of memory. So far I haven't found a solution to this. As a workaround, I recommend that you restart your game from time to time (see KNOWN ISSUES).<br><br>[h1]KNOWN ISSUES[/h1]<br>[list]<br>[*]Some snow related shaders don't work correctly. In some places there is more snow than in vanilla and in other places less. Falling snow can 'jump' when you would have changed screens.<br>[*]This mod increases memory consumption. When the game runs low on memory the performance will decline and the game might crash. This might take a while (90+ minutes). Merging room texture can accelerate this. This needs to happen once for every room with multiple screens. The textures are saved to disk (cached) and reused. It is recommended to restart the game every now and then.<br>CONTEXT: There might be memory leaks or memory fragmentation. A memory leak would mean that memory is not released when it is not used anymore. Fragmentation might happen because most roomCamera textures are now fairly large and change in size often. This means that they need to be re-allocated in memory often and they require a chunk of memory without 'holes'.<br>[*]Shadows at the edge of the screen seem to flicker or stretch in some rooms. I can see the same thing without camera scroll. Maybe a vanilla bug.<br>[*]Motion sickness might be a problem. I wonder how much is due to noise (details) in the textures. You can play around with the parameters and see what works for you.<br>[/list]<br><br>[h1]SOURCE CODE & CHANGELOG[/h1]<br>See the [url=https://github.com/SchuhBaum/SBCameraScroll]GitHub page[/url] for this mod.",

"desc": "[b]This is in beta. Custom campaign content has not been fully added, and creatures are a work in progress.[/b]<br><br>Due to the broadened range of this mod, The Friend mod has been renamed to Solace. I'm sorry for any confusion this renaming may cause!<br><br>Face the winter storm as two new custom slugcats, the Friend and the Poacher! Set between the Rivulet and the Saint. These two campaigns occur at the same time. A remix config has been created for this mod, with a few options to change how you'd like to play, and some other things as well.<br><br>Friend is the first new character this mod adds. This heavy slugcat, with their developed limbs, is exceptional at crawling, climbing, jumping and even throwing. However, they're clumsy at walking, so avoid standing up! They get just as much nutrition as any other slugcat from normal food, but can also eat creatures for a quarter of their regular food pips. Thanks to their fatty tail, they can store food better than most for when resources are scarce. This soft survivalist makes the most with what they have, and can maul. Making meals out of the weak is not their preferred diet, but in the frozen wasteland, it's hard to be picky. Especially when their lizards get hungry.<br><br>Poacher is the second new character of this mod. Their adversaries are far stronger and heavier than this slugcat, who is just a pup, so they must use their intellect to survive encounters rather than brute force. They must craft heat sources to keep their furless body warm, and can create weaponry out of many things they can find lying around. Their helmet helps to keep them safe against spears and non-fatal grasps, but don't get cocky, as they are still as fragile as any slugcat when caught off-guard. Poacher has only three food pips to keep track of, but they lack the Friend's broadened diet, and the famine is still in full swing. One of their most useful crafts is for the fire spear, which deals 1.2 damage to enemies and keeps Poacher slightly warmer.<br><br>To see a full table of what Poacher can craft, see this link:<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aT5F8irOL-l6ksxpf_fzTOe-qG44u_DAqUVYQVWiNEA/edit<br><br>This mod currently adds 3 custom creatures, a custom world state, and significantly decreased food in all regions except for Undergrowth. The custom world state and creatures are a heavy work in progress, and are nowhere near a completed state. However, it seems stable enough to play, so I want people to be able to explore! The two characters this mod adds should now be able to ascend, so players may beat the game as them if they wish.<br><br>My huge thanks goes to Noir, the creator of the NoirCatto mod. He allowed me to use his character's pole crawling code for Friend, to make them extra feral! Thank you so much, Noir! If this feature causes issues, it can be disabled in the mod's new remix config.<br><br>[u]KNOWN ISSUES:[/u]<br>- Poacher's symbol cannot use custom colors in Jolly Co-op<br>- Pebbles can talk to the characters without them having the Mark of Communication (and treats them like rivulet)<br>- Young lizards do not follow Mother lizards very well<br>- Many regions do not have custom spawns<br><br>[u]PLANNED:[/u]<br>- More regions with custom spawns (currently only outskirts and shaded citadel have them)<br>- Edited saint rooms so the two characters can traverse them<br>- More Poacher crafting results<br>- Custom intro and ending cutscenes<br>- Custom LTTM and Pebbles Dialogue<br>- For Saint, Friend, and Poacher, a new subregion of Subterranean that connects it to Outer Expanse<br>- A new region which [spoiler]combines Silent Construct and the Rot (aka, Pebbles will be at the height of his rotting)[/spoiler]<br><br>[u]KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES:[/u]<br>Singleplayer Co-op Emotes (breaks Friend's movement. Friend's movement works as expected with Jolly Co-op, so don't worry about that)<br>Omnithrow (spears will only be thrown the normal way)<br>Emerald Tweaks (overrides the color of dead danglefruits, gooieducks, etc)<br><br>[u]ATTRIBUTIONS:[/u]<br>A huge thank-you to Slime-Cubed, o645, Deathpits, Vigaro, Spinch, Fish, Bebe, Noir, forthbridge, Dual Iron, Emerald Galaxy, and the rest of Rain World's modding community! Without you guys, creating this would not have been possible. These people helped me with understanding the code, getting the characters working, making their movement unique, adding the new creatures, and getting famine code to function as intended.<br><br>Ruffles, who took the time to make the hilarious and wonderful youtube video showcasing the Friend! They have a lot of information about modding in general on their channel, and are also quite funny, so please check them out!<br><br>[u]IN-GAME TRANSLATIONS:[/u]<br>English, by me?

Blue button is palette created by you, which is located in OutputPalettes folder. Use yellow button 'New palette' to create a new palette file.<br> [b]SavePalette :[/b] Save the palette in workspace into png file. If its copy from a vanilla palette, this mod will automatically create a new palette and save it as the new palette.

Click one to choose it, it will become bigger in size, and definition of current pixel will show in a label on the top left.

If the pixel is undefined (This means game will not use current pixel as a palette color), the rect will simply not allow you to select it.<br> [b]What is gradient row : [/b]<br>      Gradient row is in order to generate gradient colors easier. Every rect in row that has a gradient label will show a small dot opon it. That means other rects which dont have label will use it as a source color to generate their own colors. Color of no label rect will lerp from the first labeled rect on the left to the first labeld rect on the right.

"desc": "[Introduction]<br>The Outsider is an overly flashy slugcat, or rather a distant relative of the slugcat. It possesses the genes of winged insects, which allows it to obtain biological fluorescence and flight ability, but also makes the Spore Puffs fatal to it.<br><br>1. The Outsider can fly. When in the air, hold down the jump button to flap your wings. The first flap of wings after each liftoff does not consume food points, but each subsequent flap will consume 1/4 of food points.<br>2. The Outsider can flare. When standing on the ground, holding down both the pick and jump buttons will consume 1 food point to release a flare.<br>3. The Outsider is a vegetarian animal. It cannot consume any meat, but as compensation, it can swallow more types of plants to obtain satiety, such as Bubble Weed, Flashbang, etc. But Spore Puffs is POISONOUS, and consuming it will immediately cause the outsider to die. Please don't blame it, there are no Spore Puffs in The Outsider's hometown, and The Outsider, like you, didn't know this at first.<br><br>I hope you will find these abilities useful... because it has to try to survive in a dark and gloomy world.<br><br>[Known issues]<br>1.Sometimes its swallowtail disappears.<br>2.Non integer food points consumed during flight cannot be displayed properly. <br>3.Seeing echoes in the first rain cycle will cause the game to fail to save. I don't think this is a bug, it's the original settings of the game, but I will try to modify it.<br>4.Sometimes Jolly Coop will replace the character controlled by the player with a survivor. You only need to switch back to the outsider in the Jolly Coop.<br>5.Although both my friends and I can use DMS, it seems that sometimes applying DMS to the outsider can still cause the game to crash.<br>6.Might conflict with swallowing everything mod.<br><br>[Notes]<br>You can customize its color in the JOLLY CO-OP. I made some modifications to the world map, and also modified the generation of creatures in each region to align them with the current timeline. But there are currently no new endings.<br>There are almost no new storylines. I am also considering the issue of balance, please don't worry.<br><br>[Other]<br>Special thanks to Harvie and Pkuyo for their help and advice. This is the first mod I wrote, so there may be many bugs that I haven't discovered yet. If you find it, please let me know. Apologize in advance for any possible bugs, hope you enjoy it!<br>Additionally, I initially only wanted to play my own OC in the game, so I created this mod. Just to fit my OC timeline, I modified the world. So perhaps it won't achieve the completion level of the campaign in the game, please don't have too high expectations for it.<br>Due to Steam restrictions, I am unable to reply to comments. I am very sorry for this.<br>If you wish to create a video for this mod, you do not need my consent.<br><br>[Bug fix]<br>1. Fixed a problem where entering a room with five pebbles caused the game to crash.<br>2. Removed the description of 'timeline' from the file, I hope this will not cause mod to fail to start again because it cannot be found.<br>3. Fixed the bug where 'Game Over' was not displayed after being killed by Smoke Fruit.<br>4. Fixed the bug where sliding down the pipeline would start flying.<br>5. Fixed the issue of rain in the Karma Gate room in areas without rain<br>6. Fixed issue where other characters cannot jump due to fixing other bugs<br>7. Fixed issues with the generation of creatures. But the old archive of The Outsider must be deleted in order for the loaded area to properly spawn creatures.<br>8. Fixed issue where using this slugcat to enter arena mode would crash.<br>9. Solved the problem of multiple cats being unable to fly correctly and consuming food points in the presence<br>10. Achieved compatibility with Rotund World. But you know, a bird that is too fat cannot fly : )<br>11. Resolved the conflict with Spore Cat.<br>12. Solved the problem of going to a room near Moon that caused the game to crash.<br>13. Fixed the issue of not being able to grasp the pole during flight using the new animation.<br>14. Fixed the issue of multiple outsiders' antennae not displaying properly after updating the animation, and solved the problem of outsiders' flying affecting each other.<br><br>If you still encounter the above issues, you can try subscribing to this mod again, as the workshop may not update in a timely manner in the game. If it still doesn't work, please let me know. Thank you.",

The arms detach when hanging from a pole however.<br><br>The 'Stun' state on the eyes/face of the grey scale costumes also reflect the chosen eye/face color when they are meant to be white.

You'll still find certain points of interest in their original regions.<br><br>[b]Q: Do gates lead to random regions?[/b]<br>No, gate connections aren't randomized! Each region connects to the same regions as it did before.<br><br>[b]Q: Why are some rooms never randomized?[/b]<br>Some rooms aren't randomized because it could potentially block your progress or make you stuck. For example, you won't be forced to travel backwards through a one-way path, unless it was there in the original game. Higher difficulty modes will randomize more rooms, but the rooms will be more difficult to traverse.<br><br>[b]Q: Can I customize which regions are randomized?[/b]<br>Yes! In the Room Rando's Remix interface, there is a Regions tab. It lets you disable randomization for each region. It also lets you change which regions' rooms can be used in other regions.<br><br>[b]Q: Why are some regions off by default?[/b]<br>Certain character-exclusive DLC regions won't be used in other regions by default because the difficulty is defined with that character in mind. For example, an easy room for Artificer might be impossible for Survivor. If you're playing as that character, or you don't care if you get a little stuck, feel free to enable it.<br><br>[b]Q: Are custom regions and rooms supported?[/b]<br>Yes! All the custom region mods I've tested have worked without issues. If you're using custom regions, I'd recommend installing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2984008852]Room Randomizer Community Logic[/url]. This makes custom rooms work with Room Randomizer's difficulty settings.<br><br>[b]Q: This mod doesn't seem to work?

There are a number of limitations & bugs. Use at your own risk.[/h3]<br><br>[h3]Description[/h3]<br>A mod that adds Pokéballs. When a creature is hit with one, there's a chance it can be captured. When a ball hits a wall or other creature, the contained creature will release. Pokéballs have a 60% chance of spawning in scavenger treasuries. Also watch out for scavengers, as they are expert Pokémon trainers (and will catch you). <br><br>Pokéballs will only tame creatures that are tamable by default. <br>Needs Fisobs to work. Has an options menu. Also source code included for those who like spaghetti. <br><br>© Pokemon Pokeball belongs to Nintendo / Gamefreak / The Pokémon Company <br><br>[h3]Possibly in the future?[/h3]<br>- Break Pokéball if capture failed. <br>- Trading rare creatures with Scavengers to get higher reputation. <br>- Multiple color/types of Pokéballs with different capture chances. <br>- Crafting Pokéballs as Gourmand? <br>- Pokémon battles with scavengers. Pokémon battle events? Free toll passthrough if player wins. <br>- Tame all creatures. (probably not because i think this is way too complex) <br>- Maybe better Jolly Co-op support? Maybe too complex. <br><br>[h3]Known issues[/h3]<br>- Slugpup relationships are removed entirely if they are kept in a Pokéball for too long, or during hibernation. Their food pips will first blink and later disappear. Release slugpups in shelters, or you need to get to know each other again as if you met for the first time. <br>- Creature relationships (if available) are not stored, instead they are reset to fully friendly. <br>- Releasing Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. <br>- Make sure players are not stuck in Pokéballs when hibernating, because that is counted as a player death. Restoring players after hibernating is undefined behavior. <br>- Getting carried into a den when you're inside a Pokéball won't trigger a death. You will need to manually restart. <br>- If you're stored in a Pokéball, and a scavenger carries you to a gate, the gate will actually activate, but the game will freeze. <br>- Pokéball doesn't like rolling up slopes. It gets stuck on edges. <br>- Pokéball camera tracking if player is stored is unreliable and doesn't work correctly with multi screen rooms. <br><br>[h3]Known bugs[/h3]<br>- If you time it right and throw a Pokéball at a DLL while it's eating, creatures can get stuck to DLLs in a unknown state upon release. <br>- Pokéball button light sometimes misaligned when carried. <br>- An exception might occur if a Pokéball hits certain projectiles mid-air (spitter spider dart). But this shouldn't cause problems afaik. <br>- BeastMaster can't spawn Pokéballs, use mod keybind option for now. The same applies to Centipede Shields, so it should be either a Fisobs or BeastMaster bug. <br>- Using Warp Menu will often change >something?< that will make you throw Pokéballs against yourself. <br><br>[h3]Reporting[/h3]<br>Please report any bug, problem, change or feature request via the Discussions, or message me on the Rain World Discord (https://discord.gg/rainworld): Maxi Mol#3079 <br>If reporting a problem, also include the steps to recreate it & the following file(s): <br>- 'exceptionLog.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/exceptionLog.txt) <br>- 'LogOutput.txt' (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Rain World/BepInEx/LogOutput.txt) <br>",

The semi-plant cell structure allows it to perform photosynthesis in the wild, use the mimic tail to attract bat flies, and camouflage.<br><br>【Ability】<br>+ Photosynthesis: Staying in open-air areas in the wild can slowly restore satiety through photosynthesis.<br>+ Prey Attraction: Bat flies will be attracted and actively approach.<br>+ Mimic camouflage: When lying down or crawling forward, it will enter a hidden state, which is not easy to be found by predators in this state.<br>+ Karma protection: In the state of full food, long press ↑ + pick up button can consume all food to get a karma level protection.<br>+ Very cute: Similar is an unbelievably cute slug cat who has something for everyone!<br><br>【Other】<br>Similar was born on Sky Island and has weaker physical fitness. The timeline and environment of his current life are similar to those of Monk.<br>Mod will continue to be updated in the future, and Similar may have more new mechanisms, plots and more original content.<br>Thank you for your love and support for this mod, and welcome your comments and feedback.<br><br>【Known issues】<br>1. Please do not use DMS (pinch cat) to replace textures for Similar, which will cause conflicts<br>2. Conflict with the straw hat MOD will cause the head map to display abnormally. If you mind, please use the cat form to play or consider disabling the straw hat MOD<br><br>【Update log】<br>16/7<br>1. New ability: eating karma flower can directly increase the level of karma under the condition of existing karma protection (you can choose to enable/disable on the configuration page)<br>2. New mechanism: the attack in the camouflage state will remove the camouflage (you can choose to enable/disable on the configuration page)<br>3. New configuration items: Now players can adjust the strength of the mimicry ability by yourself<br>4. Fixed some problems in multiplayer online situations<br>——————————————————————<br>24/5<br>1. Photosynthesis is now compatible with Rotund World (Fat World)<br>2. Other slugcats will not mistakenly use the karma protection ability<br>3. Fixed the problem that the game could not be loaded due to the straw hat MOD replacing the texture<br><br>【Author's words】<br>From Cotton:<br>Ah, I finally got to this point... It's really not easy. I'm just a trainee who just started learning programming and C# language for two and a half months. This is the first mod I try to make. Many functions are group The teachers helped to realize it (the mod code is a mess, please don’t read the .jpg), but I am very happy to think that the cute cat of Carbon Tea is finally made! Carbon tea cats are really cute (let me eat first.jpg)<br>Finally, I hope everyone can like this mod. If you have better suggestions or changes, I will talk about it when I have a higher level of programming (bushi)<br>If there is a bug (hope there will be less x), please try to bring the exceptionLog file in the root directory of the Rain World game, thank you!<br><br>From Carbontea:<br>Similar was originally the original slug cat oc I designed in 2018.<br>Similar is inspired by the red grass that can attract bat flies in the game, the mimic pole and some plants that hunt insects in reality. Because Rain World gives people the impression of danger, so I let this slug cat evolve the ability of mimicry and camouflage, and the semi-vegetative structure allows it to acquire the characteristics of photosynthesis and attracting bats.<br>I am very grateful to Teacher Xue Mian for making this design a reality after 5 years! I hope everyone likes Similar, anyway, I already like it to death.",

They possess a gall bladder able of producing a small amount of mucus per cycle, which they can spit in focused jets. However, this can leave them vulnerable to a counterattack.<br><br>[*][b]Artillery Lizard (RED_PINK)[/b]: Artillery Lizards were created as a purposed organism designed to curb creature counts. They are both heavily armoured and highly stun resistant, with the ability to distil fire powder bombs from within their own stomach.<br><br>[*][b]Blueberry Lizard (LIGHT_BLUE)[/b]: A lizard known to slugcats, originating from beyond the facility grounds. Blueberry lizards are passive towards slug cats, but are laughably weak and possess the ability to spit swallowed debris when in danger.<br><br>[*][b]Corpse Lizard (GREY)[/b]: Corpses reanimated by vast hordes of spiders, these bodies hunt to feed the hive inside them.<br><br>[*][b]Cicada Lizard (SQUIDCADA)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Dragon Lizard (HOT_PINK)[/b]: As a creature originating from the depths below the world, Dragon Lizards possess some dangerous traits. They can use void fluid stored in their stomach to fire a volley of firebug eggs each cycle, and are capable of propelling themselves through the air.<br><br>[*][b]Gator Lizard (SEAWEED)[/b]: A coastal variant of the green lizard, gators have stronger muscles and less weight, allowing them to climb poles and dive beneath the waves.<br><br>[*][b]Hive Lizard (RED_ORANGE)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Nightmare Lizard (PITCH_BLACK)[/b]: A lethal underwater predator, Nightmare lizards have adapted to the murky depths and only rely on touch and sound alone to navigate. Their lethal bite, acute hearing and the upper hand in the water should not be underestimated. [b]Oh yeah, and it's almost unkillable.[/b]<br><br>[*][b]Infant Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: An infant lizard known for its extreme aggression. They don't survive very long away from their mother.<br><br>[*][b]Mature Lizard (LIGHT_GREEN)[/b]: A slow-moving predator, capable of storing its young inside a pocket concealed within its mouth, not unlike a crocodile. It weaponises its children as a means to catch prey.<br><br>[*][b]Spitter Lizard (DARK_RED)[/b]: (WIP)<br><br>[*][b]Spore Lizard (WHITE_GREEN)[/b]: A variant of lizard, overtaken by fungal spores. It has gained the ability to spit hardened pellets that explode in gas clouds, multiple times on impact. They tend to prey on insects, and will flee from any other creature it perceives as a threat.<br><br>[*][b]Fire Lizard (ORANGE)[/b]: With a diet of firebugs, fire lizards are a dangerous predator, being able to expel fire spears at an alarming rate.<br><br>[*][b]Infested Lizard (BROWN)[/b]: Victims of contaminated water in the vast wastes below Five Pebbles, Infested lizards are nothing more than hosts.<br>[/list]<br><br><br>[i]This is my first actual mod, so feedback is very much appreciated! <3[/i]",

He was a mischievous and artistic slugcat who had a knack for graffiti, and was inspired by the music he listen to from his RainPods(tm). Every wall, pipe, and surface in his vicinity became his canvas, as he painted vibrant murals that brought color to the gloomy world.<br><br>However, The Vinki's life took a sad turn when he encountered Five Pebbles, a notorious and eccentric iterator known for his strict adherence to rules. It was an unfortunate meeting that forever changed The Vinki's perception of the world. Five Pebbles, in his unyielding quest for order, found one of The Vinki's graffiti pieces and decided to erase it with a single stroke of his overseer's laser.<br><br>The Vinki was devastated. His masterpiece was gone, reduced to mere dust. The pain of betrayal seeped deep into his slugcat soul. But he was determined to turn his sadness into something extraordinary.<br><br>As he wandered through the ruins and remnants of the Rain World, The Vinki stumbled upon a hidden alcove. Within it lay a forgotten artifact known as Soap shoes. These shoes were unlike anything he had ever seen before. They were infused with a long-lost technology that allowed the wearer to effortlessly grind rails and poles.<br><br>The Vinki saw this as a sign—a chance to not only express himself through art but to also seek vengeance in a playful yet hilarious manner. With his newfound grinding abilities, he set out to create his most audacious and eye-catching graffiti pieces yet, leaving them in the most daring and impossible-to-reach places.<br><br>From the tops of crumbling skyscrapers to the edges of perilous cliffs, The Vinki's art became a symbol of rebellion and resilience. He painted with passion, pouring his heart and soul into each stroke, defying the oppressive world around him.<br><br>The Rain World denizens, initially puzzled by The Vinki's antics, couldn't help but be both amused and awestruck. They laughed at the absurdity of seeing a slugcat grinding rails and poles, creating intricate art high above their heads. The Vinki's graffiti became a beacon of hope, reminding them that even in the darkest of times, there was still room for joy and laughter.<br><br>And so, The Vinki, the sad yet funny slugcat, continued to roam the Rain World, leaving his mark wherever he could. He carried the pain of betrayal, but he channeled it into his art, inspiring others to find solace in their own creativity. The Vinki's saga taught the denizens of Rain World that even amidst sorrow, a little laughter and self-expression could bring about profound healing and transformation.<br><br>[b][url=https://artfight.net/character/3448140.the-vinki-slugcat]Artfight link[/url][/b] <br><br>[h1]To Do[/h1]<br>[list]<br>    [*][strike]Grind in 0G[/strike]<br>    [*][strike]Grind on vines[/strike]<br>    [*][strike]Graffiti placement mechanic[/strike]<br>    [*]Graffiti quest<br>    [*]Story<br>    [*]World design changes (moar grind rails, etc.)<br>    [*]Art (for sleep screens, char select, etc.)<br>    [*]Custom animations (grinding vertically, etc.)<br>    [*]Trailer<br>[/list]<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!

"desc": "A collection of simplified custom Slugcats based on characters from my Cloudburst server.<br>[u]This is my first attempt at a proper Rain World mod, so don't expect anything to be too fancy, as it currently has no custom abilities or world changes yet. It only has custom stats and artwork for now.[/u]<br><br><br><br>Currently includes one W.I.P playable, though more are planned to be made once custom abilities are ready:<br><br>[h1]The Ascendant[/h1]<br>The Ascendant is built lightly, and as a result has a lower weight than most Slugcats. This also allows them to jump slightly higher as well as sprint faster, though they are not as agile as the infamous Rivulet.<br>They start off with a natural glow that aids them through dark areas, as well as the Mark of Communication.<br>With the help of their extra arms, they are capable of throwing a spear that deals more damage than usual in order to defend themselves, which comes in handy when the world they find themselves in is littered with dangerous enemies...<br><br>Thanks to their strange feather tufts, The Ascendant has a slightly higher than usual reputation with lizards, as they will hesitate to attack them as quickly, giving them an advantage to plan out the situation before engaging in combat. However, this comes with a cost of local creatures such as Squidcadas, Jetfish, and Scavengers having a natural disliking to you as well. You will have to go out of your way to increase your reputation with them.<br><br>Starvation is a higher risk than usual for The Ascendant, as they require 5 food to hibernate while being able to store 10 total. Plants give less food than usual, as they are mainly carnivorous. However, certain foods will fill much more hunger than usual, with their favorite food being Eggbug Eggs and especially anything Firebug related.<br><br>Lastly, the Ascendant starts off in Rubicon, and currently uses Rivlet's worldstate.[spoiler](Post-Rivulet, Pre-Saint.)[/spoiler]<br>[spoiler]If you happen to load the mod without Downpour, Ascendant will instead use Hunter's worldstate as a failsafe.[/spoiler]<br><br>[b]I highly recommend you set the tail settings to the following in Dress My Slugcat, for the best experience:<br>[i]6 to 7 Length<br>2.5 Wideness<br>0.5 Roundness[/i][/b]<br><br><br>[b][h1]NEXT UPDATE IS FOCUSING ON ADDING CUSTOM SPAWNS TO EVERY REGION ASCENDANT CAN REACH. THIS MAY TAKE A FEW DAYS.[/h1][/b]<br><br><br>[h1]Known Issues[/h1]<br>- Due to currently using Rivulet's worldstate, it also loads up Rivulet's campaign. It is very likely that Ascendant is incapable of finishing this campaign due to being unable to navigate the underwater portions of Submerged Superstructure.<br>[spoiler]Again, if you do not own Downpour it will load Hunter's instead. But since you do not start with the reset key in hand, it is still unbeatable.[/spoiler]<br>As a result the only real ending one can achieve is choosing to ascend.<br>- Unsure if this is an issue with the base game or not, but the mod appears to need to be installed after each [u]major[/u] update to detect the correct version number. I'm unsure how to fix this, and apologize in advance.<br>- Character may be a bit unbalanced at the moment, a few nerfs are planned once their crafting is implemented.<br>- Sometimes certain sprites appear to white out into triangles, this may be a Dress My Slugcat issue. Reloading Atlases or reinstalling the mod tends to fix this however.<br><br><br><br>[h1]To Do[/h1]<br>- [strike]Add Arena Mode sprites.[/strike]<br>- [strike]Add unique in-game sprites.[/strike]<br>- Add Death artwork.<br>- Add Sleeping artwork.<br>- Add Ascended artwork.<br>- [strike]Add Title Screen artwork.[/strike]<br>- [strike]Add Selection Screen artwork.[/strike]<br>- Update Selection Screen background/foreground.<br><br><br><br>[h1]Future playables[/h1]<br>- The Vorpal?<br>- The Siren?<br><br><br><br>[h1]Planned Abilities[/h1]<br>- Give Ascendant limited crafting for void/light base objects.<br><br><br><br>[h1]Requirements[/h1]<br>- [b]Slugbase[/b] allows the character to function.<br>- [b]Dress My Slugcat[/b] allows you to give the character their intended skin until I can figure out how to hardcode it into the character.<br>- [b]Open Exclusive Regions[/b] allows the character to escape Rubicon until I can figure out how to add unique gates myself, this requirement is mostly a placeholder for now.<br>- [b]Downpour DLC[/b] gives the character the intended worldstate for gameplay, as well as some of their favorite foods, and future crafting recipes. Since the mod doesn't have any mechanic dependencies from Downpour yet, it is theoretically possible to play it with the base game. Though I highly recommend against this as it will only cause the mod to break later on once these are added.",
